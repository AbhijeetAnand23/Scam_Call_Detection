0,0,"I have to say that I'm very encouraged by the underlying momentum across our franchise, notably in several areas where we've been investing."
1,1,Our Fixed Income franchise continued to benefit from strong client engagement across both our corporate
2,2,"As a sign of our commitment to Mexico, a market where we have real scale and confidence in its growth prospects,"
3,3,The amount of outstanding is 2% lower from the prior quarter and 4% down from 1 year ago. That acceleration in the reduction of the amount of outstanding shares is due to the increased amount of buybacks under the capital plan.
4,4,"the uncertainties that color the current economic environment haven't retreated. Brexit, hard, soft or scrambled, is still an open question and is likely to remain so for the near future."
5,5,"And credit costs improved, reflecting a reduction in the provision for benefits and claims due to asset sales in Citi Holdings"
6,6,this comparison includes losses on mark-to-market loan hedges this quarter as compared to gains in the prior year
7,7,"We have spent the last several years reshaping our branch network, upgrading technology and deepening our focus on our core 6 markets,"
8,8,"reflecting a modest reserve build this quarter compared to our release in the prior year, while loss rates remained favorable."
9,9,"And finally, in Latin America, we achieved growth in both purchase sales and average loans this quarter, but revenues remained down 6% versus last year."
10,10,Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter in every region.
11,11,"When we presented this slide last quarter, our first half EBIT comparison was affected by several factors, including the comparison to much stronger prior year periods in wealth management,"
12,12,We are beginning to lap the impact of our branded cards investments on rebate and rewards costs and saw a full-quarter benefit from the acquisition of the Costco portfolio.
13,13,"However, some of the current quarter reserve builds were related to Costco and the proposed regulatory guidelines I mentioned earlier and shouldn't recur at these levels. So overall,"
14,14,"And we were able to achieve this growth while maintaining our operating discipline, with expenses up just 1% even while we continue to invest in the franchise. The"
15,15,"in comparison to the spread widening we experienced last year, which drove significant gains."
16,16,"And Investment Banking revenue should be broadly stable sequentially, assuming that market conditions remain favorable."
17,17,"profitability is and where it should be. Not sure you're ready to roll out goals for next year yet, but just any guidance there would be great."
18,18,So we don't see any reason to think that we can't eventually get there. I think that the question is
19,19,"And to the latter part of your question or statement, I don't think we're necessarily forecasting that there's a lot more that we need to do from here."
20,20,"to service our clients really no matter what. And when you think about our franchise,"
21,21,we can continue to serve our clients. And we think our structured today gives us time and flexibility.
22,22,in the card space? And does that have an effect on potential returns in that business over the next couple of years?
23,23,And we thought an additional 3 basis point improvement by normalizing average cash balances that we knew that we had a 2 basis point drag
24,24,"as we mentioned in some of our commentary, we took on additional deposits to support client activity, and therefore, we just didn't get the improvement that we were seeking"
25,25,So I still would think that you need to expect some seasonal
26,26,"And cost of credit grew 8% from the third quarter of last year, driven by a larger reserve build."
27,27,enabling us to grow revenues while reducing expenses and significantly improving the profitability of our retail bank.
28,28,"Excluding Costco, we generated 1% underlying revenue growth as we are beginning to lap the investment program we started last year and a portion of the new balances are maturing to full rate."
29,29,"reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio, which did not incur any losses during the quarter as we had generally excluded late-stage delinquencies from the acquired loans."
30,30,"again, primarily reflecting the impact of seasoning and the proposed regulatory guidelines. Importantly, these NCL rates are consistent with our return goals for each business,"
31,31,"As Mike mentioned earlier, we are continuing to invest in our Mexico consumer franchise to drive sustainable growth, with initiatives to enhance our branch network, digital capabilities and service offerings."
32,32,"the early stage of our organic cards investments, the expenses we were absorbing on Costco before we had the full benefit of the revenues on that portfolio"
33,33,And Wealth Management revenues continue to recover with improving investor sentiment.
34,34,"while we still face some headwinds, we feel good about the direction of the consumer franchise."
35,35,"The TTS business remains core to our institutional strategy, delivering integrated solutions"
36,36,"However, we also expect NCLs to be higher as the Costco portfolio begins to incur losses and we continue to see the impact of volume growth."
37,37,we set out. A good piece of that will come from continued business growth and
38,38,"the positives? In other words, is that how the hedges will work? And we'll just have to deal with the negative line when things are going well?"
39,39,"a number of -- or really, all of our important renegotiations behind us, and so that's now done. And the third piece is that we've got our products in place."
40,40,Can you still kind of get efficiency savings to kind of fund a lot of that and keep expenses reasonably flat? Or how do I think about that?
41,41,translating or manifesting itself into significant changes.
42,42,I think what I heard you say is you're in the late innings for the card investments but in the early innings for additional Mexican investments.
43,43,in the cards business. We've got the positive operating leverage now in our Asia consumer business and in our Mexico consumer business.
44,44,"And Mike, on each of those, I would add to what John said, we talked about it in cards. We haven't necessary talked about it the same way in Mexico, but it holds true that a lot of the cards spend we needed to do was catch-up,"
45,45,to generate significant amounts of capital and to continue to address the denominator problem that we have in terms of continuing
46,46,"Okay. Great. And just a follow-up. I just wanted to make sure I understood your response to John's question correctly when he was asking about card. Just taking a step back, as we think about"
47,47,But we want to make sure we're there on the forefront in terms of having that technology in place and having to -- having the ability to convert as people care to do that.
48,48,"There's been a lot of commentary about potential costs. But I guess I'm just curious on the revenue side, how are you thinking about -- how that might play out over the next couple of quarters."
49,49,"And when the time is right, we'll make a decision of ultimately what we're going to do. But we'd like to benefit of as much information as possible before we make that decision, and we just don't have it today."
50,50,that would cause us to change our view as to where we can drive the cards business over time.
51,51,"But it is -- it still is generating new accounts at a faster rate than we thought it was going to. And just like with everything else with the Costco portfolio, I think we'll know more"
52,52,"In both our consumer and institutional businesses, we continued to grow both loans and deposits."
53,53,"Economic projections have improved somewhat recently, particularly in places like Brazil and Russia, which may soon return to positive growth."
54,54,"And now with the right footprint and infrastructure in place, we are beginning to invest for additional growth"
55,55,"Turning to Costco. The early results continue to be very encouraging. New account acquisitions have far exceeded our expectations at nearly 800,000 to date."
56,56,"up 2% sequentially, which offset the absence of 2 portfolios we sold in the first quarter as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships."
57,57,"We expect to maintain positive operating leverage next quarter and each year throughout the investment period, driven by revenue growth"
58,58,and abating regulatory headwinds. Retail lending revenues remained under pressure as we continued to shift our portfolio away from lower-return mortgage loans this quarter.
59,59,"On a comparable basis, card revenues in Latin America would have been down 3% versus last year, reflecting the continued impact of higher payment rates."
60,60,and the impact of significant repositioning charges in the first quarter of this year.
61,61,to our multinational clients and deepening our operating relationships with them across multiple products and markets.
62,62,"Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect NIM to remain relatively flat to this level. On Slide 14, we show our key capital metrics."
63,63,in some of the slides we used at the Financial Services Conference early in
64,64,"We've got our cash back in place. We've got our global rewards program in place, and we've built and put those out there. And now it's really supporting and driving growth, and a lot of what you've seen is now turning toward -- is the increase in terms of marketing"
65,65,"before I made any comments, and I'd certainly would like to see"
66,66,"hold ourselves to our commitment to deliver. Our people are certainly committed around that. And obviously, it's probably -- in this kind of environment, just take a little bit of time."
67,67,"And even though in -- certainly, in Mexico, this is 2 quarters in a row now of positive operating leverage. We've said that we intend to have positive operating leverage in Mexico in the fourth quarter."
68,68,that we were in a position or weren't a position through the crisis to be making those investments that we
69,69,"consistently constructive in terms of Mexico at the broad level as well as our franchise in Mexico. And in a world, certainly, for my opinion where growth -- topline growth is going to remain tough,"
70,70,"loan demand is reasonable. But again, as we think about the extension of loans, we're facilitating a client relationship with the extension of that loan."
71,71,"Well, starting at one is I don't have the statistics in front of me. But when you look at"
72,72,And so we've got flexibility. We've got our passport bank already established in Ireland. We've got the pipes connected
73,73,"Okay. And then just finally for me. In terms of the net interest margin, you expect that to be stable in the fourth quarter?"
74,74,"have a quick question on the Costco. You mentioned the new account openings. But can you give some color on the progression of those new account openings? Like, are you at a run rate right now where you can say this is about on average what we're opening per week or per month?"
75,75,"lower amount of promotional balances now, so that's enabled us to -- some of that is because the promotional balances have run off. But a lot of that is because these promotional balances now have converted into full rate"
76,76,to be able to return the capital that we're generating to our shareholders. And so
77,77,"clearly, the oil markets have stabilized dramatically from the first quarter. Are you guys seeing any opportunities to grow the energy business"
78,78,very good deposit growth in the ICG business in the quarter on a sequential basis. Did the change in the money market mutual funds have any impact on that growth? Not that we can see.
79,79,which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
80,80,The remainder of our branded cards portfolio as well as retail services also delivered modest revenue growth as did our more focused retail branch network.
81,81,"Consistent with our strategy, we continue to shift our resources to where they can generate the best returns for our investors."
82,82,"However, we were able to offset some of this impact through underlying business growth."
83,83,"On Slide 4, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp was again the predominant driver of profitability in the third quarter,"
84,84,"and the estimated impact of newly proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party collections, which I'll describe more in a moment."
85,85,"by enhancing our segmentation strategy focused on the Citigold wealth management platform,"
86,86,"We expect the loss rate on Costco to be lower than the existing portfolio, but this benefit will likely be offset by the impact of seasoning as well as the estimated impact of the proposed regulatory guidelines I just mentioned."
87,87,as well as cost savings from upgrading and standardizing our technology platforms. Turning to Asia.
88,88,"even excluding that transaction, we continue to show progress in our existing franchise with organic growth in purchase sales, average loans and revenues this quarter."
89,89,"With continued growth in purchase sales and average loans, we expect Latin America card revenues to return to sustainable growth in the second half of next year."
90,90,"Now in the third quarter, you can see that we're beginning to build momentum again."
91,91,"by previously existing reserves. And we also saw a net benefit from ratings upgrades,"
92,92,"While these positions provide an economic hedge and help us manage concentrations to any particular client, sector or region,"
93,93,"reflecting the absence of certain episodic costs, lower compensation expense and other efficiency savings, partially offset by seasonally higher marketing expenses and ongoing investment spend."
94,94,and the rest of it will come as we continue to increase the amount of capital that we're able to return to our shareholders.
95,95,and really trying to drive volumes towards -- and client acquisition towards those cards. And that's probably the spending that you continue to see from this point forward.
96,96,"what scenario we're going to be looking at in next year's CCAR test. So there's a few things that, I think, Mike and I would like to be able to work our way through before"
97,97,"I would say, and I don't put this out there as an excuse, but I think it is a reality that in a very challenged"
98,98,"Mike, I really do appreciate all the color there. And switching gears for a moment, just moving on to the capital side. I recognize some reluctance to speak"
99,99,"We have not yet begun to really contemplate exactly how much cushion we need around that because, again,"
100,100,"And the first relates to operating leverage, which this year is negative 400 basis points according to your Slide 3. That would be"
101,101,"we said going into the year that this year, because of the cards investments and the fact that the cards investments impact us both on a revenue as well as expense line,"
102,102,"And then on a going-forward basis, the way we're looking at it right now, even with the investment spend that we want to do, we do believe that we'll be able to generate positive operating leverage in our Mexico consumer business"
103,103,"And so as our clients need to expand and grow around the world, we're there to support them."
104,104,"if you went down there and looked, Betsy, is getting these branches up to where they should be from an appearance, from a technology"
105,105,branch transactions in Mexico and the way
106,106,Could you give us a more specific number just for that? Because that really is kind of a setup in a sense of a change or unusual build that wouldn't recur as you move forward.
107,107,"which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. For a complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties, we encourage you to read the company's press release and our documents on file with the SEC."
108,108,We sold a record 3.2 million tons in oil and gas during the quarter despite some customers taking extended time off during the holidays.
109,109,We continue to see very strong demand for Sandbox services and believe that we have about 17% market share of last mile sand logistics today.
110,110,"When our expansion work is completed sometime this summer, I believe we will offer our customers something that no one else can, a diverse local, regional and national footprint,"
111,111,"And along with paying our dividend, we believe these are key ways for the company to enhance shareholder value."
112,112,And the reason is that we've continued to increase the number of boxes per crew as sand intensity
113,113,I think it's one of the reasons that customers have come to us and wanted to sign additional contracts. I mentioned in my prepared remarks we now have more than 30 contracts. If you look back
114,114,might spot pricing fall below where you're contracted due to the capacity additions expected over the next several months?
115,115,"We also experienced periodic disruptions in our business due to the extreme winter weather. For Sandbox,"
116,116,Our Industrial and Specialty Products business continued to outperform the overall market.
117,117,"the ability to provide a ground-to-ground solution from the mine to the well and a supply chain network that delivers unmatched choices, coverage and flexibility."
118,118,"As previously discussed, our target is to be between 70% and 80% contracted, leaving some flexibility to sell a portion of our total tons on the spot market"
119,119,"We provide our customers with a single price per ton, which includes sand, transportation to the well and real-time delivery into the blender on site at the well."
120,120,"making acquisitions in attractive adjacent markets that have favorable market structures, increasing sales in new end uses and continuing to launch new value-added products from a pipeline of some 30 potential opportunities."
121,121,"As a result, we believe first quarter volumes and pricing will be flat and contribution margin per ton down sequentially. We believe these issues are transitory and in fact, we've already seen a pickup in February activity."
122,122,"has gone up. And also embedded in some of our previous capital spend, we're taking existing fleets up to the number of boxes that we need to run these high sand intensity wells."
123,123,other people trying to get into the last mile. So we just have to balance off that sort of theoretical view that there'd be more profitability with the reality of
124,124,rank order your preferences for capital deployment. You also have gross projects going on. So
125,125,mold that we build Northern mines. We're putting a lot of new sort of wrinkles and features into them.
126,126,Please refer to yesterday's press release or our public filings for a full reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income
127,127,when the market periodically tightens as we experienced earlier this month with the rail disruptions on the Canadian National Railway.
128,128,"Further, we guarantee that customers never have to wait for sand, and in return, we can earn bonus payments if we meet certain performance-based metrics."
129,129,Now let me turn to our business outlook for this year. I think 2018 is shaping up to be an outstanding year for both of our operating segments.
130,130,"This represents a 7% increase sequentially when compared with the third quarter of 2017, driven by a combination of higher pricing and record volumes, which benefited from the first full quarter results"
131,131,"Due to the newly enacted government tax legislation, we recorded a deferred"
132,132,"system scales pretty well in terms of capital efficiency because if you just have to add more boxes and you don't have to add some of the other support equipment, like you could still do it with 1 forklift and"
133,133,And so as we transition from the last couple of quarters where we didn't have quite as much contract coverage to
134,134,And I think that reflects the confidence that the customers have in U.S. Silica to deliver and whether it's
135,135,"to do business with someone like us who not only has the local mines, but also has"
136,136,"a differentiation in terms of quality and service. I look at the quality that we're getting out of Crane County right now, and"
137,137,"Finally, I'll comment on the outlook for our key markets. Don Merril will then provide additional color on our financial performance for the quarter and for the full year before we open up the call for your questions."
138,138,We think this new service offering will be particularly attractive for customers who sell -- source sand and want assurances of supply
139,139,for our noncontract customers. And we also expect to complete a few strategic acquisitions during the year in ISP with at least one of a substantial size relative to our current business.
140,140,"the first few quarters here in '18, we'll see some balance. That small piece that we still have to sell in the spot market, prices should be going up."
141,141,"Oil and Gas is usually pretty strong in March as well. The weather starts to warm up, and so that helps our cost a bit at our plants as we don't have to fight the cold weather there. So"
142,142,"Great. One last one for me. For Crane and Lamesa, are there any plans to forward stage sand at a transload before going to the well side? Or is that not something that you all are thinking about at this juncture?"
143,143,"Just a follow-up, can you talk to the amount of capacity at Tyler that is contracted and maybe just what you're seeing on the demand side"
144,144,I think what we're going to here in the coming months is that you can talk about opening up a mine. But actually doing it and consistently getting product out to customers in a way that you don't disappoint them is not as easy as it looks.
145,145,Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedules to attend NEXON's earnings presentation.
146,146,"Our operating income more than doubled and our net income nearly tripled from 2016. This excellent performance was driven by our key titles across the regions,"
147,147,to give you a sense of size the largest movie franchise of all time is Star Wars going back to 1977. And
148,148,or few quarters but about hard decisions we made a year or more ago.
149,149,"or the business model of even the most basic innovation, we believe that sustainable growth can only come from relentlessly reinventing our business and including the definition of what a game"
150,150,He will oversee the global business and operations with primary focus outside of Korea.
151,151,"as we grow our product lineup. Lastly, I'd like to touch on our business in the west."
152,152,"But those factors were offset by the impairment loss on items including goodwill on subsidiaries, prepaid royalties for publishing titles"
153,153,"Say OVERHIT as an example, not only in Korea but it will be very popular in other parts of the world, especially in Japan, at least that is our take."
154,154,Some people here in this room might use Siri or an equivalent technology from Google.
155,155,"about the exception to that rule. It sometimes goes a little bit down, sometimes it goes up, but it is following this general trend that is either very, very stable over time or increasing over time."
156,156,We have multiple titles in our pipeline and we are conducting our development.
157,157,"Some of you remember those questions from the time of the IPO and we said respectfully, we have no Facebook strategy, because we think Facebook is a terrible platform."
158,158,"The second thing I'd say is that if you take 1 or 2 of the big games out of eSports, people would be a whole lot less enthusiastic and those games are League of Legends"
159,159,"The gamers themselves determine that, the company doesn't determine that. And there have been a lot of examples where a company has designed what they thought was an eSports game and it just hasn't worked out."
160,160,"Again, thank you very much for joining us today."
161,161,"Today's presentation will be available on our IR website within a few days. Lastly, please make sure"
162,162,The early integration between NEXON and Pixelberry has been going very well and we've been integrating our advanced data analytics platform with Pixelberry's game operation servers.
163,163,"The game is set in a primitive universe inhabited by dinosaurs. Players explore, hunt, collaborate and fight in an effort to survive and build societies both with and against other players."
164,164,We have recently made several changes to our Western organization by centralizing and integrating some of our operations there to better serve our Western player base.
165,165,We completed our acquisition of Pixelberry in late November and we consolidated about a month of its in the fourth quarter.
166,166,as well as execute business and make judgment with a speed by delegating decision making authority for business execution to the Executive Directors.
167,167,at the situation after the Lunar New Year. But when you look at 2017 full year
168,168,So we launch new titles in Korea and we try to launch in other parts of the world once we deem it is a fit for other parts of the world as well.
169,169,"But the idea that you could talk to your game as a form of input-output, when combined with a game like Choices could be pretty interesting when you think about a virtual friend or a virtual boyfriend or girlfriend."
170,170,things are going to be more and more portable. I also think that the console companies are thinking differently about their business than they were even a few years ago. And I think -- in fact Nintendo was a leader when you look at the Switch
171,171,I think it's -- the short answer to your question is it's just way too early to tell.
172,172,"from benchmarks that we usually look at, because it is so different. I would anticipate or we will get a whole lot of"
173,173,"the reality of that are, definitionally, you can't look to comparisons to other experiences you've had and that's just a function of being a pioneer and that's what we are with this game."
174,174,"would probably be the biggest one and may be Overwatch as well. But if you took 1 or 2 of those games out, I think it would be a lot harder for"
175,175,"So, when you look at a game you have to watch what the players are doing and are they playing and broadcasting that online. So those are a mishmash of different comments about the future of eSports. I'm not sure if that's helpful. But"
176,176,to surprise many industry observers showing annuity-like performance
177,177,Like many of NEXON's and the industry's biggest hits the game's surface level simplicity you see on the video masks great depth underneath the surface.
178,178,Durango expands the definition of what a mobile game can be. There is nothing like it on mobile anywhere in the world.
179,179,We were pleased that revenues were at the high end of our outlook for the quarter.
180,180,Revenues from our China business in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations.
181,181,We'll disclose the details including the appointment of directors and amendments to the Articles of Incorporation related to the transition as soon as they are determined.
182,182,user base is very stable and it grew dramatically last year and also we were able to conduct
183,183,and I understand that the launch of these games were successful.
184,184,"I think if you project out 5 years from now, 10 years from now, it's completely within the realm of possibility that we'll be talking to our games"
185,185,about the idea of bringing something that used to exist in a living room and bring that portably with you around. So
186,186,games. Console games used to be primarily single player or group player games and
187,187,"mobile users who would otherwise play much more simple games as an example, and some of those people will see,"
188,188,the demand for the game and given that it is such a deep rich game overwhelms
189,189,"Therefore, I believe that we can operate this team for a long time."
190,190,sometime myself. But I think the point that people miss is it's primarily a PC
191,191,It can make for some very good viewing. And -- so I think
192,192,Thank you also for those of you who are joining us remotely through the live broadcast.
193,193,year after year that much more closely resembles a software as a service model than a typical entertainment industry pattern.
194,194,"The game has continued to perform well, fundamentally because our live game teams have taken a long view, focusing on bringing its millions of customers back over a period of many years rather than driving near-term revenues."
195,195,Both the game and the company exemplify the kind of innovative thinking that is the hallmark of all great advancers in games in broader media.
196,196,I'd like to show you some gameplay video of Durango which we launched 2 weeks ago in Korea.
197,197,Durango reflects our development team's relentless focus on thinking differently about games and about reaching beyond the typical conventions and genres in our industry.
198,198,"Jung-hun has held various leadership positions in NEXON Korea and led the launch and success of the FIFA Online 3 franchise as well as the successful launch of various mobile games including HIT,"
199,199,"The high end of the range reflects the fact that we expect the impact of positive drivers to be larger than the negative drivers,"
200,200,How do you plan to nurture these titles? Each game is quite different in nature.
201,201,you mentioned about the investment in the past and I am quite interested in it.
202,202,And we think that that's helped in already even without integrating much of our user acquisition and metrics -- or analytics technology into the game. It's helped to perform very well since we purchased the company already.
203,203,"as if they were virtual -- we'll be talking to virtual characters in the game because voice recognition is getting very, very good."
204,204,So could you talk about the background and also in order to repeat this with other titles
205,205,that is available for viewing on our IR website that you might have seen. But I think that
206,206,But the problem with the model and that mental model is that it's not always true and the exceptions to that model are massive.
207,207,that was in fact our single biggest question that was asked of us during the IPO road show
208,208,more and more there's an opportunity in a living room. And so we see that as an opportunity which is why we're going to be bringing more games to console coming up in 2018 and beyond.
209,209,"And when we closed that game or even after the launch of the game,"
210,210,implies a much longer period of play for customers.
211,211,We're much more interested in trying to figure out what will happen in a couple of years or over the period of a couple of years.
212,212,our capacity given how deep of a game it is. So that was -- that was something that we really had to scramble to make sure that we could handle. It looks like we're -- we've done a -- we're in a much better shape than we were a few days ago.
213,213,"first will make a blanket statement that may seem a little silly. But I think our industry sometimes gets hung up on individual topics that over the long term don't actually have a major impact,"
214,214,"people who play a lot of games, people who watch a lot of games, I had several discussions around the industry, and I think we're all watching this"
215,215,Please leave electronic interpreter device on the table when you leave.
216,216,This new acquisition is providing the group with a strong business platform in Texas that we intend to grow further. Synergies are already being captured and new revenue opportunities are created.
217,217,So this essentially is coming from an existing customer of Utility Partners that we already have for now almost a year in Texas.
218,218,This healthy diversification will continue to have a positive impact on the gross profit generated by this business pillar in the coming quarters.
219,219,Certain statements in this conference call and webcast may constitute forward-looking statements within the company of applicable securities law.
220,220,"These factors include, but are not limited to, the current significant general economic uncertainty and credit and financial market volatility and the distinctive characteristics of Vecima's operations"
221,221,"We have achieved interoperability with several of the top tier CCAP core vendors, and we've also demonstrated this to our customers."
222,222,"I'll start by reminding everyone that our results include the addition of the Concurrent business, which we brought onboard midway through the year."
223,223,"We have the technical and financial strength to continue pursuing our technology road map, and we have both the customer relationships and the track record to translate those technologies into profitable growth."
224,224,And have you been shortlisted at any of those 3 up until now? Or do you still have to go through that?
225,225,"And for the other 2, I guess at this point, it's maybe a little bit too early days to figure out whether they're"
226,226,and industry and customer demand that may have a material impact on or constitute risk factors in respect of Vecima's future financial performance
227,227,This is important because interoperability for these customers from being tied to a single vendor that may encounter technical challenges or resulting on unfavorable business terms.
228,228,"In our new Content Delivery and Storage segment, the highlight of the year was acquiring the asset with the Concurrent business and following up with a smooth integration and ramp-up."
229,229,"As a result, all comparisons will reflect Content Delivery and Storage numbers in the current quarter and current year and not in prior year."
230,230,A significant feature enhancement to the Laguna Cache is also expected to continue driving strong order flow. So we're looking at a year of continued growth for our Content Delivery and Storage operations.
231,231,going into the formal process towards trials and potential deployment. I'd still anticipate the larger operators are going to divide the market
232,232,That plays into the whole model that's being sought by the operators to decouple the core from the node.
233,233,I think we've got a very strong team there. We've got a very strong structure. It's driven by the good performance we've had in the first couple of quarters out of the gate. So that gives us comfort that
234,234,"belief or current expectations with respect to market and general economic conditions, future sales and revenue expectations, future costs and operating performance."
235,235,"At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kumar to proceed with his remarks. Please go ahead."
236,236,It's an essential transformation that will enable cable operators to compete in the new gigabit Internet speed environment.
237,237,We've also continued to demonstrate our technical agility as we keep pace with our customers' evolving needs. I believe we're positioned very strategically for this large and emerging market.
238,238,We expect the deployment of this upgrade to have a positive impact this fiscal year.
239,239,"In the meantime, we're continuing the lab trials and expect these to lead the formal trials in calendar 2019. Looking at some of our other product lines in the Video and Broadband Solutions segment."
240,240,"These are promising new opportunities that, over time, should help to offset the decline in legacy product sales."
241,241,"And as we move into fiscal 2019, I want to mention again that Vecima is now strongly positioned at the forefront of the 2 most significant market developments"
242,242,"as far as we can before having the chips and doing architectural and design work for the boards, but we need to take a fast path to adopting those chips."
243,243,our understanding is that the current set of vendors are being
244,244,The highlights provided in this call should be understood in conjunction with the company's audited consolidated financial statements
245,245,"In addition, although the forward-looking statements in this earnings call are based on what management believes are reasonable assumptions, such assumptions may prove to be incorrect."
246,246,Our distributed access node is the heart of our solution and provides the modular platform for deployment of multiple access technologies.
247,247,This increase was due to the operating results of our acquisition of Concurrent. Our
248,248,Turning to our Content Delivery and Storage segment. Our outlook remains very positive.
249,249,"Okay. That sounds good. And then I noticed in your press release, you talked about Entra being still in lab trials. So I guess"
250,250,"you'll be a supplier? Or just a question of are you first, second or third? Or do you still need to actually get selected for field and deployment?"
251,251,informal to this point. But we do believe that as they formalize the current view is that they may formalize around the current generation depending on timing. That could lead to
252,252,"This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating, and have a pleasant day."
253,253,may show some stability in the fiscal second half. So are you in your conversations with customers uncovering strong customer interest for either technology or
254,254,"mainly represented earnings from aircraft leasing, which is considered a global business."
255,255,"The performance of Free Duty was suppressed by rising costs and sluggish tourist spending,"
256,256,under our development strategy and expansion plan as illustrated
257,257,The strong performance of the construction business clearly stood out.
258,258,and further expanded the fleet size and value
259,259,the group will continue to leverage on its strong financial position to capitalize on growth opportunities.
260,260,"Both the group's environment platform are well equipped and positioned to capture the rising demand for environmental services in the region,"
261,261,A rising demand for integrated environmental services and supportive government policies will facilitate the long-term growth of the Environment segment.
262,262,has expanded swiftly over the past 3 years.
263,263,in developing an integrated aircraft leasing platform capable of providing a one-stop and comprehensive
264,264,by focusing on young and modern narrow-body aircraft and thorough risk assessments
265,265,"With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a more detailed review of the financial results."
266,266,Revenue was in line with our expectation for the quarter as insurance carriers began to re-extend budgets as it recovered from last year's severe industry loss ratios.
267,267,"is coming from Financial Services and home services. Both of those businesses have been growing at strong double-digit rates now for quite some time,"
268,268,best present and best match consumers to them in what other -- in whatever format they want to engage and whatever format consumers want to engage
269,269,"At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Erica Abrams. Please go ahead."
270,270,Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions as of today and the company undertakes no duty to update these statements as a result of new information.
271,271,"We believe that trends in Education are improving, as demonstrated by sequential growth"
272,272,"on a performance basis, whether it be policies through the rating platform, which of course is a big part of that,"
273,273,We are seeing signs and trends of stabilization there driven by those efforts.
274,274,"or clicks, which of course, is the biggest part of the business, or calls or leads or other formats. But we want to continue to be able to best engage consumers and match them to the best client in the way that client wants to"
275,275,"or the high-intent consumers but they don't have our technology platform for best engaging, matching and monetizing those consumers"
276,276,"but I think if you step back to the broader case, John, we continue in insurance to focus on our technology for both"
277,277,and generating the media economics. And so that continues to be the drumbeat of emphasis here
278,278,and the margins on all of those businesses are expanding rapidly as we have put in place the new product -- the new generation of our product and technology
279,279,but unbranded or high -- or research and compare consumer on media flows on the Internet. So those will continue to be fanatically what we do. Partnerships where we can make the media yield better or partnerships with our clients where we can get them
280,280,I want to further highlight the importance of innovation to us. We are competing in an industry worth hundreds of billions of dollars worldwide.
281,281,"because it's a quick connect, modular and flexible medical gas connector integrated within the DIRTT systems and we believe it's the first."
282,282,"Our clients are recognizing that the traditional narrative of change orders, substandard quality, project delays and inflexibility does not have to be the norm. The truth is DIRTT is changing face of construction with innovative solutions and technology."
283,283,"your expectation or your hope for further upside of this contract, has anything changed in terms of your outlook and is it reasonable to think that this going from 5 to should increase further?"
284,284,"So this year, I mean in the past you've referenced sales mix and timing as factors that have really impacted. Is it fair to say that those things are still impactful, just quarter-over-quarter you didn't see it, compared to last year let's say?"
285,285,is the pipeline still at the record levels that have talked about in the last couple of quarters?
286,286,"on time. If it's renovation, obviously clients with us have the flexibility to wait until the last minute to make their final design decisions. So"
287,287,"they take a lot of feedback from clients, from our partners and there is a great -- like our clients are also our partners."
288,288,"Before we begin, I'll remind you that certain information on today's call, including responses to questions posed could constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to DIRTT's future financial or business performance."
289,289,"We are now starting to really experience the benefits of these investments, not just with higher revenues and sales momentum, but also as evidenced by the innovations we've brought and are bringing to the interior construction industry."
290,290,We're aiming to release this development to the market in the first quarter of 2018. This is just one piece of what we believe will be the future of healthcare construction.
291,291,"And like any developing success story, our journey to this point has not been in a straight line."
292,292,"However, this is an important service for DIRTT as it helps us win more full solution projects."
293,293,"As Scott noted, we are built on a foundation of innovation and as such, we continue to invest in software and solutions development activities."
294,294,We don't really hear much when it comes to taxes or tax changes. These are growing organizations. They are always going to have capital spend. They are always innovating and they're always dealing with technology changes.
295,295,Is there any kind of read through as far as -- are you doing much smaller contracts for more customers who are willing to try you out?
296,296,"But the trend for us is, there are definitely a lot of -- especially in healthcare where we're getting medical office buildings and clinics,"
297,297,"Are you seeing any kind of resistance to signing contracts based on that? And could revenue growth have been even higher, if we didn't have any kind of concern about the environment?"
298,298,"if they were to maybe reduce their spending a little or little uncertainty, the market potential for us is still so big and they're realizing that the speed at which we can deliver our solutions, thereby allowing them to generate revenue faster"
299,299,"the fact is with our ICE software, we're taking that complexity and reducing it to the point where our clients"
300,300,"Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may affect results are detailed in DIRTT's filings with the Canadian Securities Commission, which can be accessed at www.sedar.com."
301,301,"On that note, I'll now return specifically to healthcare and then further discuss some important trends in our business."
302,302,"We are continuing to invest in new and improved solutions for this industry such as the previously mentioned integrated medical gas system, improved solutions to address infection, prevention and control and market leading acoustic abilities."
303,303,"And once again I caution investors not to judge DIRTT on a single quarter. And yes, I recognize the irony of saying this after record quarterly revenue. We are investing for the long term, and we are confident of our prospects as we move forward."
304,304,"The majority of the increase can be attributed to the increase in commissions for our sales, business development and vertical market expert as well as increases in travel and marketing activities. As a result of increased toward DIRTT's main Calgary facility."
305,305,"That's good. Actually, I think we didn't comment simply on the call. We probably should have so. With respect to timber frame, actually some excitement around that. We sold our first commercial projects during the quarter, including one to a very large"
306,306,I mentioned though there are -- there might be a small headwind from some of the commodity prices.
307,307,"Healthcare projects that would have been in excess of 30 that includes small clinics, renovations, large project in Kuwait."
308,308,"is obviously the compelling reason and I guess hypothetically to your point, if there was greater certainty. Yes, they could"
309,309,"really get a better solution on a rapidly time, completely custom with everything included."
310,310,"as a percentage going forward, because it is still so early and we're really going to release it fully commercially in January. So maybe"
311,311,"is that from U.S. Thanksgiving to the Christmas period, sometimes we do see a bit of a slowdown in activity."
312,312,"Please note that DIRTT is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements discussed today except as required by applicable law, and investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements."
313,313,"two, continuous in development within our proprietary ICE 3D design and specification software"
314,314,Our investment in solutions for this important industry is an important part of our long-term strategy.
315,315,"The value propositions of DIRTT's approach including delivering custom high performance interiors with price certainty quickly is compelling for these clients, so we're discussing longer term partnerships and agreements with many healthcare providers."
316,316,"the timber helped us secure the project, which also resulted in revenues for traditional DIRTT solutions. So,"
317,317,"and even with respect to some of the large clients things can move or they can put things on the back burner,"
318,318,increase our capabilities in healthcare and to tell our story and
319,319,kind of -- what proportion of the contract would that be applicable to in terms of
320,320,"Last year we did not see that. We saw the momentum continue, we're hoping that that's the case again this year. The projects don't get pushed into Q1, and so far it is playing out that way."
321,321,are no further questions in queue. I'll turn the call back over to Scott.
322,322,This has allowed us to generate levered returns in excess of what we would achieve by lending in the subordinate areas of the capital stack.
323,323,This will allow us to potentially realize the many benefits of this transaction earlier than originally anticipated.
324,324,"We have worked extremely hard in the last few months to put ourselves in the best position to close this transaction as soon as possible, which would allow us to realize these benefits earlier than anticipated."
325,325,"As we have mentioned in our last few calls, we have experienced a significant amount of runoff in the last few years, which has made it difficult at times for us to continue to grow our loan portfolio."
326,326,"which, given the current uncertainty and stability in the capital markets, puts us in a unique and favorable position"
327,327,"We are also very excited about the acquisition of our manager's significant agency platform,"
328,328,This success continues to add to our core earnings capabilities and diversifies our income streams.
329,329,"In addition to the filing of our definitive proxy, which is available on both our and the SEC's website,"
330,330,"while the banks were extremely aggressive, specifically in the New York City, Metropolitan area, I think, they've really overstepped their bounds and they're pulling back a little bit."
331,331,"I think people have to stabilize their assets a bit longer to get to the kind of execution that they want. And of course, benefit of exiting earlier has gone away. So I think we'll see a little more duration in our portfolio,"
332,332,"the strategy on those assets. But as we -- as I put in my prepared remarks, the lion's share of the portfolio has been sold, either"
333,333,"we feel we've achieved the right value in that asset, and we can redeploy that cash"
334,334,"We are optimistic that this progress will allow us to close the transaction as early as the end of the second quarter, again, allowing us to realize the many significant benefits of this transaction"
335,335,This has also resulted in a significant increase in liquidity to deploy into new investment opportunities and grow our future earnings.
336,336,of being able to acquire our manager's significant agency platform and grow our business and future earnings without the immediate need to issue additional capital.
337,337,"Additionally, we have been extremely successful in leveraging off of our unique platform and consistently creating significant additional income streams."
338,338,"These strong results continue to demonstrate our unique ability to create significant additional earnings through new business ventures and from structured transactions, which we view as an important part of our franchise"
339,339,"And with the addition of our manager's agency platform, we will add significant additional long dated income streams through a predictable annuity of servicing income from a prepayment protected significant agency servicing portfolio."
340,340,"prior to the quarter or subsequent, therefore, the NOI associated with those assets has obviously disappeared, but it's turned into cash"
341,341,"These statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future performance, taking into account the information currently available to us."
342,342,"earlier than expected, including the potential to increase our dividend in the third quarter. Now I would like to talk about some of our first quarter accomplishments and our outlook for the remainder of 2016. We"
343,343,"We have also continued to enhance our debt structures, which is one of the keys to our success and remain a critical component of our business strategy."
344,344,"duration and stability to our earnings streams. And we feel strongly that the many benefits we will realize from the acquisition, we will have a transformational effect on our future growth and success."
345,345,our manager's agency platform and some of the significant benefits of the proposed acquisition. We hope this additional information will be helpful to our shareholders.
346,346,The riskiest part is always in the early stages. So I think that the longer day that we can have on some of our
347,347,how is pricing in that market and execution in that market looking currently? And do you expect to be able to access it in the near future?
348,348,These presentations should not be considered an alternative to GAAP measures. A full reconciliation of these non-GAAP items is provided in the financial tables in today's press release.
349,349,"we have identified more than 2,600 stores nationwide as candidates. We remain confident that we will find accretive purchases in the near term to increase our portfolio and continue to grow earnings."
350,350,but they're starting to get that it's about total gross and total volume and it's not individual per-unit numbers.
351,351,"through synergies as well as through corporate staff, but the stores are starting to get it as well."
352,352,"Great. And then lastly, as you look at leverage, you talked about delevering, I think, a half a turn since the beginning of the year. Do you sort of have a target leverage"
353,353,our ability to respond to the marketplace and the intellect that occurs even at corporate level
354,354,"So they're not working in a vacuum and they're not looking up to us for answers. That, combined with the autonomy, has allowed us to attract and grow what we really believe"
355,355,of SAAR rates that are in excess of what the average is. And I think this is going to be the first year of that in excess.
356,356,the throughput number becomes more difficult because the delta between that and the gross
357,357,but we do believe that there are pricing pressures and other competitive pressures that could occur with independents.
358,358,"events, like you suggested, can be elixirs to create more acquisitions. Right now, there is just so many out there that the ability to be selective has been"
359,359,"and their ability to attract talent into their organization now in metropolitan areas, much like our exclusive areas, has provided them the ability to grow now. So we are spending"
360,360,I don't think we will see that either because I think that there is a market for deals in certain size.
361,361,"we're not seeing a lot of weakness still there. Even though mid-single digits is a little more challenging than what we found in the past,"
362,362,We remain optimistic that pent-up demand stemming from the past 7 years of new vehicle SAAR performing below averages will be realized over the next few years.
363,363,over the third quarter of last year. Throughput or the percentage of each additional gross profit dollar over the prior year we retain after selling cost
364,364,that values may soften a little bit as supply begins to loosen. And I think those trends may continue as the SAAR rates continue to climb as well.
365,365,"also on the used vehicle side, to make sure that -- as you cycle DCH and some of these larger deals, that the total can grow in addition to the same store?"
366,366,"We really believe that the pipeline is full, and that was maybe a little bit slower than what we would expect in the future. And I think it's because there is such a vast array of selections."
367,367,"a valuable role in the finance transactions, so this isn't about eventually not making finance reserve. What it's about is it's about the disparate treatment with the consumer. And so what we're finding is not just Honda but"
368,368,"that may not sound like a lot, but what happens is the responsiveness"
369,369,"that, I think, we're more shrewd in terms of how acquisitions are looked at and the ability to strike quickly if there is a downturn,"
370,370,"is the best talent and will continue to be the best talent, which is how you make it through those trying times in more stable ways."
371,371,"in revenue, so that's something that we're going to be looking at. I believe that can come before a recession would ever possibly hit because"
372,372,"starts to become more impactful. So pay attention to that, but obviously with DCH, it does make it a little more attractive for the short term."
373,373,"really good from our standpoint. And I think that, that has a pretty good runway for the next 5 to 10 years that we'll continue to see that because, ultimately, when there wasn't those acquisitions over the past decade,"
374,374,"a considerable number of deals and that there can be some price softening because, over time, if they don't sell because they're asking too much, they eventually"
375,375,"I believe that they know who they are and what they want to become. They have a wonderful culture. They are humbly confident, much like we had talked about."
376,376,Okay. And then one follow-up questions. You just mentioned the DCH -- the New Jersey comp. Is there anything specific that was going on in New Jersey that impacted the performance?
377,377,The fourth quarter is off to a good start with the acquisition of Concord Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram and Fiat in California.
378,378,"This opportunity will drive growth in all 4 business lines, complementing the push for market share gains and greater earnings by our store leadership."
379,379,"As a result, we have ample liquidity when necessary to complete larger acquisitions."
380,380,"And setting these estimates, we would remind you that our approach to guidance remains unchanged. We generate a bottoms-up model using current store performance and current market conditions to derive overall company performance estimates that have a high probability of success."
381,381,"residual values, and the Manheim index has shown quite a bit of resilience, I've been getting a lot of questions about if and when that's going to roll over and"
382,382,This is Sid. I'll just confer with Bryan there -- I concur. I mean it's pretty much -- this is kind of a stable position we're in now. There's no extremes.
383,383,"we're pretty, pretty confident that a quarterly number of 17.8 million may be more typical, which is going to require a little bit more inventory."
384,384,"I don't know, consternation about where we are in the new vehicle selling cycle. And do we want to own or recommend dealers"
385,385,"are guided, to some extent, from Medford corporate offices. However, they have the autonomy to move as their individual markets determine"
386,386,and the time to market to be able to change your approach is much more proactive. And I think
387,387,that I just believe that the organization is positioned in a nice manner to be able to respond in multiple ways.
388,388,"I think, if we keep it simple and we keep focusing on the 4 core parts of the business, we're going to continue to execute at a higher and higher level with the teams that we have. And so"
389,389,"And I don't think I heard you mention, but I would assume as well perhaps that -- more acquisition opportunities if the market was to start to turn just considering the age of the average dealer-owner and perhaps"
390,390,"my true feeling is, is that -- and it's something that we provide in our investor packet."
391,391,they are still going to sell because obviously the age of the dealer body is what drives it.
392,392,come back to where the real market is going to be at on those deals. And I think that takes time. And each dealer is different of how they look at it and how their financial advisers
393,393,"I do believe that there's revenue growth opportunity when we look at the volumes because, overall, our volumes have only been up low single digits so far this year, even though that's not in our same-store sales numbers,"
394,394,"dominant areas of influence with what we would call average or underperformance, that we can buy stores and provide wonderful multiples to our sellers"
395,395,"There was. Actually, if you remember, January and February, were hard hit with weather more typical than it normally was, which has now happened 2 years in a row."
396,396,"This improved optimism, coupled with strong performance in the first 9 months of the year, has allowed us to increase our outlook for 2015. Chris will be providing more detail to follow."
397,397,"I think we'll have a balance of those. We have our fingers into most deals. There's recently been 2 larger deals announced, of which"
398,398,"additional execution. And as we've said, our guidance doesn't bake into that additional execution beyond what we're going to see in our current markets. So there's a balance between the two."
399,399,"of our growth plan, I think it's important for us to make sure that we have a balance sheet that can acquire"
400,400,given the progression we've seen for new vehicle sales are now tracking above 18 million SAAR? So I guess my question is
401,401,and as their team see fit. And I think that's vastly different than the top-down culture that Lithia was 7 to 10 years ago
402,402,"you can see it in our market share as an organization, up 10% to 12% as a whole over that time period, which is a vast amount"
403,403,"Chris, you may talk about our transparency in our measurements and the way that we budget and forecast because that could be more detective to be able to see those things before they occur."
404,404,There's a slide that shows what occurs in a recessionary period and what occurs after a recessionary period.
405,405,"upside. And I think, if you look at the benefits of that, then you start to get into the units and operations in service and the ability of supplying used vehicles to grow. Plus, you have the"
406,406,"is that we went through a decade or a half a generation of depressed values because of the recession, and I think that's what's really driving it. I think -- if there is some type of"
407,407,so -- and I think the DCH team is actively pursuing and attacking that again. They've figured out how to make net and to control their expenses.
408,408,"was really pleasing to see that our 2 organizations, who if you recall knew each other historically but"
409,409,and we're pretty close on a number of different deals. And we're very fortunate that these are sizable deals relative to what Lithia's typical acquisitions are because there's higher volume.
410,410,that it's great in their eyes because they haven't been able to see the opportunities that profits could double or triple.
411,411,"You are hereby cautioned that these statements may be affected by the important factors, among others,"
412,412,"Kirk and I each have some remarks about the first quarter. After that, we'll open the line for your questions."
413,413,So we would expect to initially see a lower census at those locations until we materially ramp our admissions.
414,414,We recently completed the expansion of Oxford treatment center by 24 beds.
415,415,"After taking on the additional operational oversights since the departure of our COO, and spending the past three months in the field working directly with our facility CEOs, I can tell you that we are making dramatic improvements across all areas of our clinical operations."
416,416,Non-client related revenue includes marketing and diagnostic services provided to third parties.
417,417,"primarily related to the growth of residential average daily census and outpatient visits combined with an increase in salaries, wages and benefits."
418,418,of which we were impacted by 43 days in the quarter that we were temporarily unable to bill for services
419,419,"So the document requests, is that something you can just add initially or do you actually have to submit the bill and then wait for them to ask for more clinical documentation? So can you preemptively do that, or is that too difficult?"
420,420,So we're seeing it all over the board with the insurance companies. But I do feel like the processes we're putting in place are alleviating some of that.
421,421,The benefit is we have the ability to grow into the capacity over the next 24 months without requiring additional capital.
422,422,"They started setting up their own laboratories about 5 years ago as well. And so I think that you're seeing the insurance companies just respond back and make sure people have medical necessity,"
423,423,create some studies for the payers but I'm curious if your sales team is also leveraging that a lot as they go out in the market with speaking to
424,424,"So it's still going to take about another quarter to fully get that into the field. But that is our game plan for the back half of the year is to have a lot more conversations with referral sources, payer sources"
425,425,had hoped it would. We've got a lot of work ahead of us in Q2 and Q3. But we feel like that we started down the right path. We are continuing to improve our clinical programs out into the field as well as our physical plant.
426,426,I'd like to begin with some results from our longitudinal outcome study and our commitment to client quality.
427,427,"And we had some technical challenges in Q1 that we were able to resolve. We continue to see some documentation requests obviously in the lab that we would expect to continue, however,"
428,428,"And that's really why we're building out our sales team. The whole goal is to build out the business development team and the call center over the next several quarters, but you're not going to see that result really into the back half of the year."
429,429,So it really prevented us from getting that census out in Laguna above 20 to 30 on any consistent basis. We just had that
430,430,some of the referral sources whether it be unions or hospital emergency department. Is that something that's kind of in their arsenal yet to help drive referrals or is that also on the come?
431,431,"about the fact that we are following our patients, we are trying to track them long term. We want to stay engaged with them long term, and our goal is to reduce use over time. The ultimate primary goal is to get abstinence."
432,432,"We know have good solid outcome studies that we're starting to see that are very, very promising. And we feel like American Addiction Centers has built a solid platform that we'll be able to build upon over the next several years."
433,433,"The company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise."
434,434,"Outpatient business growth has been driven by the Townsend acquisition and the growth of our outpatient business in Las Vegas and Arlington, Texas, which is benefiting from the growth of our sober living census."
435,435,"We remain focused on growing our business, development team and call center representatives as well as our call volume."
436,436,"So if you just clog the system with every single insurance payer out there with documents, I think it would be another problem."
437,437,"for that lab test, which I think is all appropriate. I think we see this in our field all the time, where there's a little bit of outside of the box happening with some providers and then the payers start to"
438,438,"I don't know many competitors that are conducting research studies like that. There's not-for-profit agencies out there that I can point to and I think we're very comparable to some of the research studies, we've seen from others"
439,439,"It's on the come. I mean we actually had a really good meeting with our business development management team this week in Nashville, and we were talking about that."
440,440,We expect to see an increase in our admissions in the second half of the year. We also remain focused on cutting costs.
441,441,The decrease in the revenue per admission was due to lower diagnostic services as a percentage of revenue and higher percentage of revenue being derived from in-network facilities.
442,442,We would expect to start seeing the leverage from these cost-cutting measures over the next several quarters.
443,443,The marketing team is putting together some collateral. First we wanted to get some of the studies done. Like you don't want to put out data if it's not fully baked.
444,444,"Second, it has seasonality and can be sensitive to holidays, group bookings and special events."
445,445,"Demand for economy tier lodging has grown rapidly in China in a relatively short period of time, as the middle class has rapidly expanded."
446,446,"This transaction will expand our presence around the world, broaden our appeal to younger travelers and increase the growth opportunities for Starwood's valuable brands."
447,447,"For those of you who have followed us for a while, you also know we're serious about transparent disclosures and delivering high returns to shareholders."
448,448,of completed hotel renovations and higher branding fees from residential sales as several projects should begin sales during the year.
449,449,"For shareholders, we will continue to look for ways to leverage the scale and opportunities from this transaction to drive value beyond the base case synergies we've outlined for you, and we intend to do all of this as quickly as possible."
450,450,And that's why we mentioned in the prepared remarks that our expectation is sort of towards the higher end of that 3% to 5%. But there's enough uncertainty out there that we thought the 3% to 5% range is probably a
451,451,"And we think that probably had nearly a 1-point impact because of the blizzard on the East Coast. And so all things considered, that's not bad, and we'd expect February to be better."
452,452,really again both drive the top line and the bottom line. So we feel really good about this. I think the only
453,453,will be harder to get financed than deals that were signed maybe a year ago.
454,454,"These -- on the hotel side, we're looking at several hotels coming off of renovations, which is great, and they've got some nice growth"
455,455,"And we'll work through those things with both. We don't fear either of those issues, though, and think actually that we will find a way to create"
456,456,have you guys got 2016 -- we would expect that New York is going to continue to be a fairly challenged market with
457,457,"There generally, though, is not an impact on tax basis from the transaction since"
458,458,"Like you, we eagerly await this afternoon's comments from Starwood about their business trends."
459,459,"In any given quarter, it's sometimes difficult to see which of these aspects of the business are most impactful. This was true in the fourth quarter."
460,460,"and a modestly lower GDP growth assumption for 2016. Elsewhere in the world, economies in Italy and Spain are recovering nicely, while German economic growth has cooled with fewer exports to China."
461,461,economic growth in Africa and easing comparison in Egypt should improve results late in the year.
462,462,"were affiliated with one of Marriott brands, more than any other hotel company."
463,463,"Excluding transition and transaction costs, we continue to expect the transaction will be EPS-accretive in the second full year after closing."
464,464,"While the Starwood transaction will do much to change Marriott, it won't change those commitments. I'm looking forward to getting to know as many of you as possible in the coming months."
465,465,"Further, we expect higher credit card branding fees, with growth in new accounts and cardholder sales."
466,466,Our business strategy enables us to grow rapidly in a strong market and continue to deliver attractive returns in a weaker one.
467,467,"As we approach the integration of Marriott and Starwood, we've identified a few guiding principles."
468,468,not a whole lot more than that. There is obviously some seasonal variety depending on whether it's first quarter or fourth quarter
469,469,continuing to drive sales and to drive the development engine. And we've taken steps to
470,470,"So as we talked about before, Harry, the numbers that we're looking at in all of the things that we're talking about today reflect only Marriott, kind of core legacy Marriott. So"
471,471,of early reports that have come out that that's a point lower than what we thought a quarter ago.
472,472,more constructive place for us to be than to try and move it by only 0.5 point. It gives us a little bit more room to see what happens with GDP growth.
473,473,"And so if there's a risk here in the near term, it is that some of these deals either will get delayed to some extent or some may even be killed if debt financing cannot be made available."
474,474,"foreign currencies have a more profound impact on their business, given their international mix than we do. And that is a piece of things. That piece is not surprising, obviously. We see"
475,475,"So first, the most important part is to look at the partner in this particular situation, and that is we're working with one of the largest hotel operators in China on this particular deal."
476,476,"in part because of the strength of Eastern Crown as a franchise operator and in part because of the structure of the deal. But I think increasingly,"
477,477,"in those numbers. On the residential side, we definitely are now seeing kind of"
478,478,"most of it not very positive in what we read in the papers here. And obviously, a big chunk of that is related to"
479,479,"Obviously, it is a very big market. And so the performance in different cities will vary from place to place. We had some of the numbers in"
480,480,"And it is driving great performance in our Japanese hotels, and you see that sort of growth in outbound China business continuing to perform"
481,481,that really makes up the bulk of the difference in terms of the CapEx spending. But then when you look at
482,482,So let's get started. Attendance at the ALIS Conference in LA of this year was a bit late due to the deluge of East Coast snow. But there was still a lot of conversation at the conference.
483,483,"Despite Russia's ongoing recession, we saw higher domestic demand in our hotels in Moscow in the fourth quarter. Security concerns continue to weigh on demand in Paris and Brussels and, to a lesser extent, in London."
484,484,"In the Caribbean and Latin America region, solid economic growth in Mexico is driving both RevPAR and hotel expansion, while the Caribbean remains an attractive venue for groups"
485,485,"will create a very attractive portfolio that should be more appealing to guests and meeting planners, and thus, more appealing to owners and franchisees as well."
486,486,"We know you have many questions about our brand strategies, integration plans and specific efficiency opportunities. We don't have answers for you today and ask for your patience as we work through these decisions and plans."
487,487,"We believe this acquisition is as significant. It will make us the largest hotel company in the world,"
488,488,"Incentive fees in international markets declined 12% in the quarter, reflecting tough foreign exchange comparisons and a few weak markets in the Middle East and Latin America."
489,489,"Even after completion of the Starwood transaction, we intend to remain a solid investment grade company with strong access to capital markets."
490,490,We will continue to put people first. This is our cultural touchstone because taking care of associates enables them to take care of the guests.
491,491,"try and put our arms around those teams of folks, so that they are as little distracted by this as possible. I think some of the other deals we did early, it was that sales engine, which looked like it got distracted"
492,492,"By doing that, we think we will provide efficiencies to our hotel owners and franchisees."
493,493,"obviously, we would assume that -- and hope that once we've acquired Starwood, that you would see share repurchase go even higher than the numbers that we've presented."
494,494,"Transient business is the hardest to predict because it does not really have much of a long lead time, particularly with business travelers."
495,495,It's going to vary a little bit by type of owner partner or franchisee partner. I think those that
496,496,"like some of our competitors, we want to make sure that we are playing in all of the segments, which are relevant to the growing China middle class,"
497,497,"the -- that business has really picked up from 2013 through 2015, as you saw the residential market rebound. And so as we look out into the future, we've got a number of other projects coming on board"
498,498,any sort of direct influence on these asset sales is nonexistent.
499,499,"in many cases, the costs of those hedges are so prohibitive that it's really better off to stick with the risk. Now I will also say that we do"
500,500,"the amount of recycling that we did do in '15 and what that led to in terms of share repurchases, the real difference when you look into '16 is, number one, we're starting off"
501,501,"I'm not sure it goes quite so far as to exclude any. I mean, what our base model assumes is that over the course of the first couple of years or so, we will get the combined larger company back to"
502,502,these hotels can be sold in every instance at dramatically higher multiples than what the earnings contribution are from them.
503,503,"We believe it was the modest growth in GDP in the fourth quarter that constrained our transient business, particularly premium-rated business."
504,504,"and an appealing warm weather playground for tourists, particularly after they dig out from under 2 feet of snow."
505,505,"We believe the transaction offers meaningful opportunities for shareholders, hotel owners and hotel franchisees through enhanced growth and improved efficiency."
506,506,We believe this transaction will create substantial value for Marriott and Starwood shareholders and look forward to working aggressively towards its completion.
507,507,"focused solely on management and franchising, with a very strong portfolio of great brands, powerful loyalty programs and terrific prospects for the future."
508,508,We will provide more information about the transaction during the second quarter earnings call.
509,509,"We will be out of the market until after the special shareholders meetings, but expect to resume share repurchases as soon as possible thereafter."
510,510,We recognize customer service is the foundation of every lodging brand and RevPAR premiums.
511,511,but largely represents the fact of a few more percentage points of hotels earning incentive fees.
512,512,move all of one portfolio hotels to some other property management system from the one that they've got and instead find a way to
513,513,"We'll provide ease of operation, and we should free up resources to invest in a loyalty program system and some other things, which are much more strategically important."
514,514,"But then we look forward to being back in the market as aggressively as we can and look forward to still hitting those numbers, assuming all goes well for the rest of the year."
515,515,"profoundly the case when you look at Group business, but it is also very much the case when you look at"
516,516,"when you think about revenue synergies, and they're the hardest things for us to put a number out there. We don't have one for you now. Hopefully, when we get to a point of digesting the acquisition and sharing in more detail with all of you"
517,517,"is nothing that gives us cause for... And at this point, how much of your anticipated group bookings are on the book for this year? And how does that compare to historical trends?"
518,518,"are -- tend to be more in the center part of the country, more conservatively financed, more regional banks probably will continue to be"
519,519,"again, this is not a deal that is based on one quarter's numbers or necessarily even one year's numbers, but a deal that we think is"
520,520,"And I think from that standpoint, it will allow us to leverage a large number of hotels quickly and get them into our fee stream by working with somebody like that."
521,521,"and not purely being in the luxury space, which is really where we've been so far. And this is a way for us to get there. We'll continue to expand the rewards program, and I think expand the"
522,522,"First of all, I would say the three areas that we mentioned, roughly fairly even. So when you look at where the growth is coming from, whether it's the owned, leased hotels"
523,523,"involved in the details on each asset sale, so I can't really comment particularly about how we would see"
524,524,"I think underneath all of that, you've got China continuing to move towards a consumer economy."
525,525,in part because of the political implications of some of the street protests and
526,526,"the China New Year's has shifted from January to February, so we'll have to get through February and see exactly how the"
527,527,that's -- so that may help us get to that number. But I think that's going to continue to be a market we slog through. I think the oil patch will continue to be
528,528,"There are some things we still don't really know in detail, actually, a lot of things we don't know in detail. But part of this is making sure that we"
529,529,"When you look at EBITDA multiples, it becomes a little bit closer. But even there, it's a great portfolio of assets that we would"
530,530,"wanted to start with an incredibly unimaginative question, but we've seen a major renewal at a major European video neighborhood in the past day."
531,531,you said that a majority of the capacity was renewed and pricing was better. Can
532,532,What sort of improvement are you factoring into your guidance in Fixed Data?
533,533,in terms of revenues. And that's objectives that are the basis of our contractual
534,534,"Drew, given the revenue and the earnings forecast for next year, and I know we're going to get a lot more detail on this on 4Q, but can you give us a sense of how you're feeling about free cash flow next year? And then any"
535,535,"Second area would be around the customer success. Those folks will be more responsible for picking up a customer after the initial sale, making sure that they're doing"
536,536,These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.
537,537,"we are cautious about the upcoming year. But before I talk more about our overall operational progress as well as our future growth strategies and outlook,"
538,538,"Ultimately, it's not a matter of if fiber but when. The question that remains then"
539,539,"Important also to Phase II is obtaining product approvals at the national carriers. Beyond our success at regional players to date, we have earned product approvals for parts of our product line"
540,540,"At this time, it remains difficult to determine when a meaningful market rebound will occur, which is why we're forecasting the first half of fiscal 2018 to be consistent with the same period last year."
541,541,"Though the significant growth won't come immediately, the market opportunity is vast and ours for the taking. And if there is any indication as to where Clearfield can go in the next couple of years, one has to simply look back"
542,542,It's important to note also that the company undertakes no obligation to update such statements.
543,543,in expense attributable to costs associated with the patent infringement lawsuit brought by CommScope during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Not only are we defending our position that our innovative solutions do not violate any valid patent
544,544,"we will also be opportunistic in how we deploy our cash, including the potential to acquire complementary technologies or businesses that can scale our growth even further."
545,545,is what are the steps we're taking to not only return to our historical 15% compounded annual growth rate but also capitalize on the significant future market opportunity.
546,546,strategic alliances and market and product line enhancements. We will take a disciplined approach to Phase 3 investments as we want to ensure that we prudently work to size our company to current as well as future revenue opportunities.
547,547,"at the last decade since the recession and see how we've grown the business through a compelling value proposition, disciplined investments and an unwavering focus to profitably scale the business."
548,548,"Although ongoing product approvals will be needed to successfully penetrate the national carrier markets, this has been an important step for us."
549,549,"So to summarize, due to the size and expansion of our TAM along with our recent certifications and product approvals gained,"
550,550,"Unfortunately, net income has been and will continue to be negatively affected by the lawsuit, but we are confident in the process and in our intellectual property."
551,551,"That's helpful. And then just, I apologize if I missed it, but a clarification on your OpEx outlook for fiscal '18. I know you said it"
552,552,The Risk Factors section in Clearfield's most recent form 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission provides examples of those risks.
553,553,"is uniquely beneficial to Clearfield, allowing us to introduce our labor saving technologies deeper into the decision trees within these large providers."
554,554,"The increase for the year was due in part to additional personnel to support our sales and operational expansion plans, enhancements to our current product lineup"
555,555,"Given that the case is ongoing, we cannot comment any further and will not take questions today specific to the case."
556,556,Every new material code expands our exposure and supplier position with these carriers.
557,557,we believe we can return to and exceed our historical 15% compounded annual growth rate while maintaining profitability as we achieve scale.
558,558,we are continuing our programs to lower our cost of sales through industry partnerships and lower labor sourcing.
559,559,"Over time, as we achieve scale through Phases II and III, we believe we can achieve net income as a percentage of revenue"
560,560,Okay. That makes sense. And then just looking at the competitive landscape. So you really think the headwinds you're currently seeing are really related to the spending
561,561,is going to be consistent with '17 levels. Is that including the potential legal expenses related to the ongoing suit? Or is that backing legal expenses out of that compare?
562,562,is being well received by consumers who are looking to take charge of their health.
563,563,"options that they have. So we're very excited about this because this is not a price play. This is about the value you're offering on many parameters,"
564,564,"pretty much always a cost play, it's the easiest one to deliver. So we're very confident in our ability to deliver those synergies and then importantly, because of all the things we talked about around our service and our quality"
565,565,"When you think about our Patient Service Centers within a short period of time, that's a fairly fixed cost. Our logistics and even somewhat some of our laboratory expense, although obviously reagents and some labor are variable."
566,566,References to adjusted operating income for all periods now excludes amortization expense.
567,567,Our offerings are popular across the entire demographic spectrum
568,568,and it continued to build in Q1 so we saw an improvement in February and also in March.
569,569,and we are well down the road in conversations with several other nationals on similar concepts
570,570,really across the board in the regions that are growing as one might expect because
571,571,"So what I'll say is this has picked up a lot of steam, and we are encouraged because"
572,572,"Second of all, you did mention a customer bankruptcy in your prepared remarks, if I heard you correctly. I'm curious was that Trident since they are"
573,573,We believe the cuts could potentially eliminate the majority of their profit and will provide a catalyst for market consolidation.
574,574,"which supports our plan to gain share. This is clearly evidenced by the opening of major health plan contracts at the large national laboratories,"
575,575,We're working hard to educate a whole new group of physicians on the Quest value proposition but it does take time.
576,576,incorporating innovative uses of building design and automated technology to provide a broad range of advanced diagnostic information services to more than 40 million people.
577,577,Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 0.5% compared to the prior year driven by strong volume growth and favorable weather partially offset by increasing reimbursement pressure and higher patient concessions.
578,578,So we've had quite a lot of interest from the other national payers about what this means
579,579,We've also shared that Aetna is going to move to that similar approach
580,580,"certainly have enough sense around the industry and knew it would be difficult for a lot of people to meet the criteria around service, access and quality."
581,581,"So we're in dialogue around addressing that. So we have not changed anything to our compensation program in response to that, and we're feeling comfortable -- we're obviously doing the right things"
582,582,"growth in the lab market to flat. And so as we look at the overall performance in the first quarter against our expectations and all the factors that play into it, including"
583,583,"if not eliminated, which will help the revenue relative to the volume. So I think"
584,584,"which provides the best value and quality for patients, physicians and payers."
585,585,Massachusetts has been a leader in price transparency by launching its own website to help consumers understand the wide variation in health care costs.
586,586,"agreeing with that and then getting behind that by naming us as one of those preferred providers so that consumers of our services, both the patient and the"
587,587,"I guess, any sort of meaningful movement on that front? And should it be assumed that any sort of relief would occur in 2021? Or how should we be thinking about timing?"
588,588,"clear on the changes, the impact of those changes and how much it's going to expand to the hospital and others that did not submit last time. But we do know and agree that it's going to be challenging for many of them"
589,589,"our competitiveness, there's nothing that we saw in the first quarter that suggested a significant deviation from what we were expecting in terms of,"
590,590,"Let me begin today with a brief overview of our first quarter operating performance, followed by an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook."
591,591,"We continue to deliver on our commitment to returning cash to shareholders while investing in our people, innovation and future growth."
592,592,"With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. We continue to see healthy global demand in our commercial, defense, space and services markets."
593,593,We continue to see the trend of diverse and balanced demand from a geographical perspective as well as across the spectrum of airline business models.
594,594,"Much of that investment supports the priority we have placed on capturing future franchise programs,"
595,595,We aim to grow faster than the average services market growth of 3.5% as we further expand our broad portfolio of services offerings and continue to gain market share.
596,596,"Earlier this month, we announced a number of new products and services across the BGS portfolio, including tools powered by Boeing Analytics"
597,597,"In summary, with growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remains intensely focused on growth, innovation and accelerating productivity improvements that fuel our investments in the future."
598,598,"Before we go into the business performance, I should also note that with the adoption of the new accounting standards, including revenue recognition, as of the beginning of this year, we've adjusted our financial statements to comply with these new standards."
599,599,"leverage the talent and innovation across the company. At the same time, we will continue to set challenging goals and objectives around elements of operations and support functions tied to profitability and efficiency"
600,600,"In addition to the strong commercial airplane market dynamics I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we've taken our own actions to reduce cyclicality in our business."
601,601,we are as optimistic about our future and the future of our industry as we have ever been.
602,602,"Achieving these objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on the profitable ramp-up in commercial airplane production, continuing to strengthen our defense and space business,"
603,603,"I think when you look at the 777X, a lot of what you talked about is what's been taken into account in our forecast. So obviously, building the static aircraft"
604,604,"And I think just the fact that you can see our production system continues to run well, we're continuing to meet our customer deliveries,"
605,605,it grow across all regions around the world. We're seeing general increases in trade levels and transport levels.
606,606,"not only certified but getting them into the production system on time and doing that smoothly. And that, obviously, is"
607,607,"from any of the others in a positive sense? And then on BGS, I think you commented around favorable mix. Can you just"
608,608,that your target incorporated the Iran order? And could you just tell us roughly how many aircraft would have been involved this year and next year?
609,609,"that we've put in place, is not dependent on the Iranian orders. If those orders do come to fruition, if we do ultimately deliver airplanes,"
610,610,"strong and continued funding of those NASA programs is really important to our country, and that sustained funding and support that we're seeing from the administration is very encouraging."
611,611,"Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussion today are likely to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release,"
612,612,"Now let's move to Slide 2. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of employees throughout our company,"
613,613,"There also is more balanced demand between fleet growth and replacement of older aircraft, and we are seeing more consistent and stable customer purchasing patterns."
614,614,"International demand for our defense and space offerings remains high as well, in particular, for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters and satellites."
615,615,"and our cash position continues to provide us with flexibility to invest in innovation and profitable growth opportunities while, again, returning value back to our shareholders."
616,616,"growing our integrated services business and leveraging the power of our 3-business-unit strategy, delivering on our development programs,"
617,617,that program other than early inventory build?
618,618,"And I think some of the upfront work we did on derisking is -- you're seeing that paying off, but we're watching it closely."
619,619,"Does that -- it puts a little bit more life into that variant. Does that impact the configuration of a future NMA, perhaps, at the high end? And what's the latest"
620,620,"of not only the airplane but, perhaps, even more importantly, the associated production system, taking a hard look at the business case."
621,621,"But to me, this is not one where we're going to be making a decision just based on a schedule that we have to meet. This is about having a disciplined business case,"
622,622,"and having those in inventory as well as the blanks that we're firing, the risk mitigation efforts that we're putting into the line is also taken into account,"
623,623,how that's impacting any customer discussions and then also how you're thinking about
624,624,"And while some initial statements have been made about potential tariffs, none of those severe actions have been implemented. And we're, frankly, encouraged by the continuing dialogue, and we've heard from leadership in both countries that"
625,625,Can we look at that -- or do you guys see any other indicators that the large
626,626,it looks like several hundred basis points of sequential change that you had in the quarter keeps going or if that slows down as you move through the year.
627,627,"it looks like it has to ramp very sharply to get to your full year bogey. Is that number, perhaps, a little bit conservative?"
628,628,"the damage of sequestration and a challenging defense budget, we're now seeing reemerging strength of that budget supported by both parties."
629,629,"Boeing delivered strong first quarter 2018 financial results that included higher revenue, earnings and operating cash flow, driven by solid execution on production programs and services."
630,630,We believe the evolution in key market dynamics in the aggregate are driving greater stability and far less cyclicality for our industry.
631,631,"While we still have more work to do to fill the remaining 777 production slots, based on our progress on maturing commitments into firm orders, managing the skyline and working new campaigns,"
632,632,"We continue to see repeat orders for the 787 Dreamliner, as demonstrated by the order from American Airlines earlier this month"
633,633,on the strength of the aerospace industry fundamentals. It is important to have this in perspective as we navigate through global trade discussions.
634,634,They reflect our customers' recognition of our value proposition in helping them optimize the performance of their fleets and reduce operational costs through the life cycle.
635,635,"These new service capabilities are driving life cycle innovation in the form of faster flow times, lower operational costs and enhanced end-to-end reliability."
636,636,in this important sector. Highlighting again the value we bring as One Boeing is the recently announced memorandum of agreement for a joint venture between Boeing
637,637,The key wins during the quarter underscore the strength of our One Boeing offerings to our customers.
638,638,"As we look towards the remainder of the year, we remain focused on strong execution and risk mitigation within our company and throughout our supply chain."
639,639,"All of these will help us achieve our goal to grow year-over-year revenue, cash flow and margins. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for closing comments."
640,640,"We maintain strong relationships with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders around the world, and we will continue to engage in our own efforts to proactively work with different governments."
641,641,"driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth,"
642,642,"Reliability for the fleet in the field is very high, so we're pleased with the performance of the program."
643,643,"Timing of that decision is still to be determined as we work our way through the details. We have time to do our homework and do it well,"
644,644,"the impact on the supply chain and how you do things, whether it's aluminum, titanium, et cetera?"
645,645,"making our first delivery. So again, that mix will start to pick up some pace here"
646,646,And you're seeing that improving. So I think the team is executing extremely well not only in our factories but reaching back into the supply chain
647,647,"presumably, you must be planning what to do. You must have some contingency plans"
648,648,"along with President Trump, has been a very important step. We're encouraged by that as well. And we're continuing to invest in that area. We do see it as an important business segment for our future."
649,649,"And we have a great program that's producing capability that our customers need, and we're looking forward to continuing to"
650,650,"In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosure and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook."
651,651,"Based on our strong first quarter 2018 performance, we are raising full year guidance for operating cash flow, earnings per share and Commercial Airplanes operating margins. Greg will discuss these in more detail shortly."
652,652,"Additionally, earlier this month, we completed all planned supplemental-type certificate flight tests for the Tanker program, a very significant milestone that we've been aiming towards since we took first flight 3 years ago."
653,653,we continue to believe the rate plan we put in place establishes a floor for the program and supports our production bridge from the current 777 to
654,654,"In this market, both our commercial and defense customers remain focused on improving aircraft readiness and availability"

657,657,"Thank you, Greg. With a strong first quarter on which to build continued momentum for the year, our team remains focused on further driving both growth and productivity."
658,658,"We have executed on our long-term strategy of robust and continuing organic growth investment and returning value to shareholders, complemented by strategic acquisitions that enhance and accelerate our growth plans."
659,659,"Our priorities going forward are to leverage our unique One Boeing advantages, continue building strength on strength to deliver and improve on our commitments"
660,660,usual. Is there anything in terms of the inventory levels we should think about where you might do the same in terms of getting some additional buffer?
661,661,"So good core performance. And again, I think the productivity focus we've had for the last number of years and continuing on that path and sharing of best practices across the entire company"
662,662,"And what you see in this quarter is another step of progress towards that longer-term goal, and we expect to make sustained progress"
663,663,"So it's a lot cleaner, I'll say, comparison when you look at unit versus program, and you're -- again, you're seeing the fundamentals"
664,664,We're still driving towards a goal of beginning to have operational capability towards the end of this year.
665,665,"It's all electric and achieves a minimum range of 150 kilometers, and the first orders have already been placed."
666,666,"And to emphasize it again, the sales performance is a result of limited product availability and not due to low demand."
667,667,"At the same time, we will take into consideration the sustainability in our payments."
668,668,"We see typically down in the fourth quarter. Of course, I can tell you we had a certain sales effect as we have also referred that we get to a normalized"
669,669,"as long as we do get this into payments, so to say. That is also something we need to consider."
670,670,"into this product. On the other hand, we have never said that we don't do any money with electric cars."
671,671,"But as you know, I would like to have the EQC already today. But you know that there are some certain things to be done in development and introduction to make it happening."
672,672,"The automotive industry and also Daimler continued to operate in a very demanding environment. Given the variety and the complexity of external factors, we are content with the results of this third quarter."
673,673,"To sum up, the group's results showed the solidity of our business, but also reflect the manyfold challenges we faced in the past quarter, but we continue to invest strongly in products and technologies to be ready for the future."
674,674,The decline in volumes as a consequence of restricted vehicle availability caused by the delays in certification and the temporary weaker pricing policy had a negative effect on earnings.
675,675,and by expenses in connection with ongoing governmental proceedings and measures taken for diesel vehicles as well as by lower unit sales caused by delivery delays.
676,676,We continued to see unchanged high demand for our cars. That's why we expect that the situation will return to normal in the fourth quarter
677,677,The company is now able to focus even more on the implementation of its strategy and to operational business.
678,678,We are confident of achieving further long-term profitable growth and creating value for our shareholders by continuously investing into the future.
679,679,"want to reduce our inventory by more than 50,000 vehicles in the car group"
680,680,it's very precisely to really find it out in the combination of everything in this nearly impossible.
681,681,"negative, of course, as the volatility will be reduced with regard to our delivery delays and"
682,682,"On the other hand, when you look at the overall development, the credit loss development, which we are disclosing in our appendix of the"
683,683,"Here, Daimler will offer a broad-based program in order to demonstrate to you what we're doing in order to tap the future opportunities."
684,684,as well as further efficiency enhancements. Higher expenses for raw materials and the weakening of the Turkish markets had negative effects.
685,685,"We expect a positive sales development also at Daimler Buses, especially in Europe and in Latin America, though with less dynamism than previously expected."
686,686,We continue with our transformation towards the future of mobility. The large investments we have made and continue to make in the strategic case fields are bearing fruit already today.
687,687,"Personally, I have decided to place my task into younger hands after the end of my contract."
688,688,Daimler continues to be an interesting and attractive investment case with an attractive dividend policy. I now look forward to your questions. Thank you.
689,689,"in the first quarter, and that should of course impact our cash flow. On top, we have also informed the market that our dividend payments from China"
690,690,"does generate a net income, which is higher than the equity you need to grow the business,"
691,691,"On the one hand, in the research and development area, of course, had also a negative impact in the third quarter, but also -- that was also true in the second and the first quarter, and that will be true also in the fourth quarter."
692,692,"There is, of course, a huge dividend payments for the total year. We are missing one"
693,693,"I'm happy to see this development, and that should also give us a possibility also to work on pricing and cost"
694,694,We had mentioned that the pricing and the intensive spendings are very much related to this -- to our issues we had in the
695,695,"And this will not only be done with a regular program in context of the entire fair, but we will also have 3 of our board members present in Las Vegas to answer and to present to you."
696,696,reflecting the stronger increase in inventories because of restrictions in the availability of vehicles caused by the delay of certification processes at Mercedes-Benz
697,697,"Due to the previously mentioned expenses in connection with the ongoing governmental proceedings and measures in various regions with regard to diesel vehicles,"
698,698,"Thank you very much, Bodo. Ladies and gentlemen, you may ask your questions now."
699,699,"That includes, of course, the higher investments, on the one hand, as we have mentioned, but also the"
700,700,the free cash flow and the cash flow spending in Financial Services is more or less determined by the growth of the portfolio.
701,701,"again in the fourth quarter. Of course, I even can tell you there might be even some customers, which we have lost,"
702,702,the product pipeline is a strong one as we have also new products now up and running.
703,703,"But when you look at the total average, we are well positioned also for next year that you don't see"
704,704,"And this is not only on the passenger car business, this will be mainly also about the Daimler Trucks, too. So we look forward to see you at the beginning of the year."
705,705,"Moving to Slide 7. And I won't go through this in detail, but these are all the mills that now have capabilities of making"
706,706,"very favorable, and we're well positioned to take advantage of the growth moving forward."
707,707,"as you move into 2019, it would have a material positive impact on our numbers."
708,708,but there really isn't that much choice. There have been a number of bankruptcies. A number of those have come back from the dead. But
709,709,"On the board grades, we've run all the way up through to our 24-point caliper, and we're very pleased with the quality and the results of that. And we've been working very closely with"
710,710,"going forward as well, operating rates are good at the moment. And that's enabled us to put through the price increases that we've seen."
711,711,"the recent conversions are giving us flexibility. At Maastricht and Somerset, we now have the ability to swing between graphic paper"
712,712,Moving to Slide 12. We thought it would be useful to just update on the recent
713,713,"We've done a great job at getting selling price increases through. And clearly, there's still a little bit more to be done, but we have made those announcements, and we're confident about being"
714,714,"We expect net debt to reduce further in this quarter. It's always our strongest quarter, Q4, so we should see reduction. And based on the current market conditions and exchange rates,"
715,715,and specialty and packaging grades. So that allows us to take advantage of the respective dynamics in each of those markets.
716,716,"I do want to stress that although the project did take a little bit longer, the quality of the product coming off"
717,717,especially over the last couple of days. But I will point out that half the quarter is gone already.
718,718,and we think some of that's got to do with the fact that the selling prices on the coated mechanical haven't gone up to the same extent. So we've seen a little bit of shifting around there.
719,719,"production that we were short this quarter, we would expect that to come back next year. Plus,"
720,720,And we'll just start to see the volume come up and the price come up on that product as we move through the -- into
721,721,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. At this time, we would like to welcome everyone to Cosan's Second Quarter"
722,722,"Investors should understand that general economic conditions, industry conditions and other operating factors could also affect the future results of Cosan and could cause"
723,723,"This delay will not compromise our targets of reaching the top -- the high end of the guidance range in terms of crushing,"
724,724,"Historically, sales of own products are more concentrated in the second half of the crop year when prices are usually more attractive."
725,725,"This year we saw a crushing delay in the beginning of the crop, resulting in lower availability of own products this quarter"
726,726,"by incorporating those mills to the Project, which is our centralizes operation center, and this can be done relatively quickly."
727,727,"The pace of conversion was lower this quarter as it was in the first half of the year, but there is no change to our full year guidance in terms of CapEx or to the number of service stations that we expect to convert."
728,728,"and this increases the availability of own products for sale, but also because sugar prices were very favorable in early crop as well as ethanol prices that had an atypical appreciation."
729,729,"In order to facilitate the understanding and comparison of results, we've incorporated the currency effect of hedging sugar exports"
730,730,Prices dropped in March with the anticipation of the crushing but quickly reversed the usual downward trend and went up during the crop's first quarter last year.
731,731,"But it is important to stress that since July we have been seeing adjustments to diesel and gasoline prices almost every day,"
732,732,So once again we show our guidance for the full year. There has been no change whatsoever to the numbers presented last quarter.
733,733,"This conference is being recorded at the request of Worthington Industries. If anyone object, you may disconnect at this time."
734,734,"will result in meaningful improvements in margins, return on capital and growth for our company as Transformation 2.0 becomes part of our daily routine."
735,735,"And finally, our ZNW venture in China continues to ramp up with trial orders being produced for target customers there."
736,736,We continue to add people with outstanding experience and capability to the growing consumer products team.
737,737,"and even in our corporate support functions. There's great energy in the spread of Transformation 2.0 work as we accelerate the deployment of more teams, expand our abilities, move more quickly and reach deeper into the business."
738,738,a year ago for a period of a couple of quarters. They had
739,739,"because we have not done any acquisitions recently and we have not been buying back stock, we've basically accumulated cash. I would not expect that"
740,740,"And it's very limited, very small, not material to our overall purchase. So we do not understand what's going on there and we'd look to you to explain that."
741,741,"The days inventory that we have on hand is lower than it's ever been. And our delivery performance, our service levels to our customers, is higher than it's ever been and more consistent."
742,742,But I think the way we think about capital allocation has not changed much at all.
743,743,We are proud of our employees who seem to be embracing change and working hard to drive improvements.
744,744,very high material spreads because of what happened with steel prices over a year ago getting very low. A little bit of that has come back. Their volume continues to improve.
745,745,"or say that our goal is to have a large cash balance going forward in perpetuity. Ultimately, we want to find good places to invest that cash, whether it be"
746,746,So you cannot look at it on a per unit basis. That's misleading. And I will tell you that we have not reduced prices for any Cylinders that I know of.
747,747,they did not succeed as well with the first transformation partly because of all the acquisition activity that we were doing.
748,748,So that's the kind of benefits that you should be looking forward to across the business.
749,749,We want to fund a nice steady dividend. We like increasing our dividend as the company's performance improves.
750,750,"focusing in our core and then we will selectively look outside. But if we do go outside of our core, there's likely to be smaller businesses where we buy them,"
751,751,"Was the question do they have them? Or are we including them? No, have you seen any, in the most recent quarter here, ended?"
752,752,"We saw strong performance from Steel Processing, modest improvement at Cylinders and Engineered Cabs and a modest decline in joint venture income. Strength in automotive and construction was offset by continued weakness in oil and gas and agriculture."
753,753,There's more activity in the eastern part of the country
754,754,"And I would also say the third quarter, as you know, John, for a lot of our businesses, just happens to be a seasonal low point."
755,755,"We want to dramatically increase the good stuff and dramatically decrease the bad stuff, and we are able to do that pretty constantly. And what that translates to on the bottom line is the kind of improvements that you see for us"
756,756,"We do fund -- and in fact, I was explaining to a group of our employees this morning, we fund our capital projects as we find good projects to fund"
757,757,"And so while the improvement is not incremental and it is dramatic weighted against the earnings of the company,"
758,758,"the current trend in the steel prices, some of which has already happened and where we are in the quarter there's going to be"
759,759,"Yes, I mean, that business tends to follow what our steel company does. We don't calculate their FIFO gain or loss because we're really just reporting an equity income number."
760,760,"However, we are seeing green shoots as revenue and bookings have increased modestly over the past several months."
761,761,our original Transformation first reached critical mass about 8 years ago as they continue to push back the edge of what's possible there.
762,762,"penalties associated with it. So it's not particularly economic to do so. And frankly, the way we think about it, we like to have"
763,763,enthusiastic that suddenly the oil and gas business is going to be back to where it was 4 years ago. But capital budgets for the big exploration companies and
764,764,"in the trade cases, it looks like March imports are going to be up pretty dramatic. Do you have any theory as to what's happening?"
765,765,"I would say that was some recovery. And a couple of their software end markets really gives them the ability over the next couple of years to really drive what I would think would be pretty substantial,"
766,766,"current priorities right now in terms of maybe your top 2 or 3, which ones are the strongest maybe in terms of buybacks or acquisitions or"
767,767,"as it relates to whether new plants, new equipment. We fund those. And we've been doing that the last 5 or 6 years, and we will continue to do that."
768,768,"In Cylinders, there's probably just more raw opportunity globally, new products, new markets consolidating some of our existing businesses."
769,769,"And for the fifth consecutive quarter, free cash flow more than covered the cash dividend paid."
770,770,"to the yard in Ingleside, Texas, where it arrived in early October and where construction of the project's production platform will be completed."
771,771,in LNG liquefaction volumes have leveraged the positive impact of these favorable market conditions.
772,772,"We have a clear strategy, a competitive and differentiated portfolio, which we are expanding and reshaping to increase margins with a focus on OpEx and operational performance as key measures of success."
773,773,Let me close out. Our results today show that we are successfully pulling on powerful financial levers that strengthen the balance sheet.
774,774,"In terms of the performance of our manufacturing and chemical sites,"
775,775,"Prelude and Appomattox, the growth we're seeing in our shales business as well. So solid growth coming through for the next couple of years."
776,776,"I think the credit rating outcomes are an outcome of fundamentally good performance, and we're doing all we can to continue that trajectory."
777,777,"and we've got good shale opportunities in our portfolio. What we're looking for on the oil and gas side is the most competitive, highest-return marginal barrel or marginal ton of LNG, if you will."
778,778,So I wouldn't -- there's nothing for me to kind of highlight in terms of anything unusual happening from a capital profile perspective in the Integrated Gas business.
779,779,"The other things you mentioned, working capital. That's really a story about the current price environment. There's nothing else"
780,780,"have the right strategy, execute that strategy and generate the cash necessary to"
781,781,I think we're pulling all the levers to make that possible and to be in a much better position in terms of increasing distributions to shareholders over the next couple of years.
782,782,"We are very pleased with our position with Basrah Gas Company. We remain committed to the country, and we believe there's future opportunity with that business and potentially other projects as well. So it's very"
783,783,"pretty confident in terms of the business that we have and not seeing kind of negative headwinds, if you will."
784,784,demonstrate a company that is delivering on the strategy and should be in the position for the financial framework to get to where we want to be
785,785,"We've done that review. You see the impairments that are coming through relatively light, a good chunk of those having to do with"
786,786,"I think your second question related to -- I think it was a cost question, if I'm correct, in terms of what's flowing through."
787,787,That more than compensated for the divestment program and the decline. So that would be a good example.
788,788,you would want to keep customers either filling up or charging up at your stations so you can take advantage of the non-fuels retail offering. So
789,789,We're trying to bring these power offerings together. We also see the trend with electric vehicle
790,790,"On the cash taxes, indeed, there has been a transition happening in the company"
791,791,"as an operator, you really need to see to unlock"
792,792,"So just -- it's been in motion for a number of years, and so I think it's somewhat difficult to draw conclusions"
793,793,"removing the dividend withholding tax. That hasn't happened yet. But if that were, then"
794,794,"All right, I think we have got to our last question."
795,795,Our results today show that we are successfully pulling on powerful financial levers that strengthen the balance sheet as we continue to reshape Shell's portfolio and transform the company.
796,796,as additional volumes to existing plants like NLNG continue to strengthen the resilience and competitiveness of our supply portfolio.
797,797,"These investments will be channeled into expanding and improving the retail network, improving the fuel logistics infrastructure and developing partnerships to deliver world-class products and services to consumers and businesses in Mexico."
798,798,The hull will form the base of Shell's largest floating platform in the Gulf of Mexico.
799,799,"This move will allow Shell to provide customers the flexibility to charge their electric vehicles at home, work and on the go."
800,800,"driven mainly by supply disruption. And in Chemicals, industry cracker margins were impacted by higher feedstock costs,"
801,801,"It looks like refinery and chemical plant availability both took a little back step in the third quarter. I know there were some fires at some of the sites. But the question is -- I mean, is -- do you think we -- Shell will be able to get"
802,802,"no concern about the direction of travel. It's really the circumstance of the quarter in terms of some of the cash proceeds. In addition to that, we had"
803,803,Vito indeed is one of the growth options that we have in the future. It is one of many. There's a fierce competition for capital at the moment in the organization.
804,804,"Things like the Motiva transaction, the portfolio changes also having an impact."
805,805,"I think, indeed, we've made a huge amount of progress over the last couple of years. You're seeing that come through in the numbers."
806,806,there's something that could come -- could surface that would be interesting for us to consider.
807,807,"Our commitment is to get our leverage and our gearing down to 20%. We've maintained our commitment through the dividend via the scrip program. As part of that,"
808,808,"In terms of the provision question, indeed it's a good opportunity for me to highlight. We had an accelerated payment"
809,809,"We recognize that, that new capacity needs to come onstream -- needs to be absorbed in the next couple of years."
810,810,"did in the third quarter. And again, I want to go back to a point that I've been trying to make in a number of different responses. We're really focusing on the fundamentals and ensuring that we are"
811,811,"In terms of the trends on capital, indeed in the fourth quarter, we have some trending up relative to prior quarters. That's just the nature of the projects and how capital is flowing."
812,812,participation. We want to provide our customers whatever fuel they would like to have. And if it's
813,813,"We will invest in Downstream to grow in markets where we think there's real opportunity. We see that opportunity in places like Mexico. So indeed, I think you will see more coming from that business, but it's not a big draw on capital."
814,814,until it really looks like it's going to get across the finish line. We've been in Nigeria for decades. It's an important country for us.
815,815,"we have a lot of growth coming through at the moment, and we see continued growth in the next couple of years. And again, it's across our portfolio."
816,816,"over time, and we're starting to see that coming through now and I expect more to come through the medium term from both of those businesses. And of course,"
817,817,we could take a look at the structure. But we'll need to wait for that to actually come to fruition before we move into decision-making in that space.
818,818,Thank you for your questions today. Let me remind you that we will have our Management Day on the 28th of November in London and on the 29th in New York.
819,819,This competitive performance is further evidence of Shell's growing momentum and strengthens our firm belief that our strategy is working.
820,820,"As part of our retail growth plans, we opened our first service station in Mexico, and now we've opened a further 10 sites with more sites due over the next few months."
821,821,This is a major milestone for Shell and shows our ongoing commitment to Mexico.
822,822,This is an important milestone for a key project which has the potential to boost production in the Gulf of Mexico
823,823,"When you add this customer offer to our current rollout of fast-charging points on Shell forecourts, we believe we are developing the full suite of charge solutions required to support the future of electric vehicles."
824,824,partially offset by the impact of supply tightness in Asia and Europe.
825,825,"of projects come onstream. An important point to make this quarter is that the Motiva transaction completed earlier this year resulted in the full consolidation of the Norco and Convent refineries,"
826,826,Our divestment program continues to make good progress on both raising cash and reshaping the company.
827,827,"We are demonstrating good delivery against these levers, and I want to further strengthen the momentum with a strong focus on performance management, simplicity and costs."
828,828,a reset of the value of the debt associated with the appreciation of the euro. So some of our debt is marked
829,829,"well, first of all, we should point out, Harvey had an impact, a material impact at our Deer Park site, and that certainly impacted availability for the quarter."
830,830,What I will say is there's a commitment to continue to improve the performance of our company to reduce the cost framework or cost structure of our company.
831,831,"I've talked about the various levers on the cost side, underlying operational expense coming down"
832,832,"But I think what we're focusing on is really to focus the fundamentals of the company and focus on operational excellence, capital efficiency, cost efficiency. We've done a lot in that space, we think there's still some more running room for us"
833,833,"as well. That's normal course of business, so I don't think there's anything fundamentally changing or being signaled"
834,834,"when we get to a line of sight of 20%, we will take the scrip off, and then we'll move into a position of balancing"
835,835,energy supply that's very much needed and will continue to be needed as populations grow and quality of life increases across the planet.
836,836,"Looking into the 2020s, there hasn't been a number of large FIDs, given what we expect to happen with the LNG market. We think there should be some tightening in the early 2020s. The exact date,"
837,837,"you have the equity positions, you have transactions that are in the pipeline and you can see reaching the 20% number,"
838,838,"delivering the strategy and generating the cash to be robust, resilient and competitive in the future. And I think that's what you're seeing coming through in the numbers. We've been very clear in terms of what our cash priorities are. It is debt repayment,"
839,839,We test across a range of price assumptions in terms of assessing the value.
840,840,prices and margins rather than cost and growth. Okay.
841,841,position we've taken. I think it touches on a number of things that we're doing as a company. We've got our New Energies business up and running and
842,842,"electrons and if it's V-Power and if it's hydrogen, we want to be there for our customers. And we're looking to bring a portfolio of products to our customers."
843,843,"So I think that is part of the reshaping of the portfolio, and the impact has been between that"
844,844,"At this point in time, there is no update. We think this remains the right rule of thumb for the business."
845,845,"In general, we've been able to move it to a much better place in the last couple of years. We're very pleased with our discussions with the government,"
846,846,"The acquisition of BG accelerated our strategy, brought a lot of growth opportunity into the company. So if you look at Brazil in particular between when we announced and where we are today,"
847,847,"We're, I think, in a pretty good position, a pretty privileged position from a portfolio of options that we have"
848,848,Thank you for your input on the financial disclosure. We do want to be transparent. We do want to provide relevant information to our shareholders so that we can accurately -- and provide the most
849,849,"Again, I'll go back to how we're running the company and the way we look at our businesses. So you mentioned"
850,850,Ben and I and other members of the executive team look forward to speaking with you all then. Thank you very much.
851,851,Our retail offering is providing Mexico's motorists with high-quality Shell fuels and retail services.
852,852,Let me move to the macro environment in the quarter.
853,853,which has added to our earnings in Q3 but also led to increased operating expenses and depreciation compared with the same quarter a year ago.
854,854,"Fundamentally, this is an important opportunity to continue to improve Shell's competitive performance irrespective of oil prices."
855,855,We are improving our returns and delivering a better financial performance. This competitive performance is further evidence of Shell's growing momentum and strengthens our firm belief that our strategy is working.
856,856,"But as you mentioned, we also had a couple other things going on at the outset. They were relatively one-off in nature. So they're -- I wouldn't say it's pointing towards any fundamental operational issues or concerns."
857,857,"We believe Vito is a strong project and will be one of the options that we'll be looking at. But it's one of many, and as I said before, we're -- we have a"
858,858,"So again, the cost reduction trajectory continues. We're going to continue to pull that lever. I think there's still more for us to do in this space. But we're also trying to grow at the same time. So we -- I mentioned Mexico"
859,859,"you, Christopher. I am pleased that the credit rating agencies are recognizing and seeing the performance of the company. I"
860,860,I think it's probably best to direct you to IR. There's some specifics in that that's not probably
861,861,"they're not strategic positions. We will sell them, but we'll sell them for value. And it's really just a matter of when and getting the right timing in terms of exiting those positions."
862,862,"sort of taking that into account, I wanted to ask you if your own views on the outlook for LNG are"
863,863,"So we think the fundamentals are very strong. Indeed, a lot of supply has come on in the last year, will continue to come on in the next 1 to 2 years. So far, the market has absorbed that supply very well."
864,864,"would that be sufficient for you to lift the scrip? And I guess, put that into context of one of your competitors who has already made the commitment to"
865,865,"maintaining the dividend, taking the scrip off and then moving to capital allocation and buybacks and getting that balance right. We think that's the right sequence of events."
866,866,"The challenge with these kinds of variance analysis is there's lots of ins and outs. So maybe just to tease out a few things that I said earlier,"
867,867,"But of course, there is growth happening at the same time, which is going to be an offset to some of that underlying performance."
868,868,looking to help drive new business models and be part and to lead the energy transition.
869,869,We're not receiving any pressure on the dual listing from the government. That can be a topic of interest. Our dual listing
870,870,and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for more detailed discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projections and any forward-looking statements.
871,871,which is bolstering our confidence and returning to consolidated revenue growth in the second half of the year.
872,872,"As I evaluate the performance of beverage and snacks, it is clear that these platforms are entering the second phase of the Value Creation Plan."
873,873,The completion of our expansion project that added retail bagging capabilities in Mexico allows us to ship directly to customers.
874,874,"were offset by structural investments made in the areas of quality, sales, marketing, operations, engineering and other functional resources"
875,875,"These efforts continue to generate productivity improvements in cost savings in manufacturing, procurement and logistics."
876,876,"Finally, during the quarter we also invested considerable time and resources into pack plan readiness across the company's fruit facilities in California and Mexico in preparation for the 2018 strawberry harvest."
877,877,"To sum it up, we have confidence in the efficacy of our Value Creation Plan initiatives and look forward to updating you on our continued progress."
878,878,"It will take a few quarters to work through this plan. And as a result, we expect to see frozen fruit continue to weigh on our consolidated margins, at least into the fourth quarter."
879,879,"trying to give folks a sense of the weight of the fruit pressure we're experiencing right now and working through, and so that's going to be the primary driver of pressure in the second quarter."
880,880,"that sits inside of the first quarter, that does not include the pressure that also comes from fixed cost coverage, which is not as efficient as it was,"
881,881,obviously influences when you're going to have the ability to regain the business and start growing the business again.
882,882,"may be been more action in the refrigerated section in nut-based beverages, but are you able to kind of navigate this transition"
883,883,So I think the diversification that we've done in the portfolio is allowing us to grow the category quite nicely.
884,884,and we see that category continuing to have good growth potential in the forward years as well.
885,885,"put the growers in a position where they've had to extend their fresh season to try to make up for the lost revenue that they incurred during that weather pattern, if you will."
886,886,"The company undertakes no obligation to publicly correct or update the forward-looking statements made during the presentation to reflect future events or circumstances, except as may be required under applicable securities laws."
887,887,This growth was driven by strong performance in both the aseptic and premium juice categories.
888,888,The lower sales and margin partly reflect our investments in price that began during the fourth quarter as well as our efforts to improve quality and deliver a high level of customer service.
889,889,We are also planning to utilize the most cost-effective combination of our California-based facilities as we process a reduced strawberry crop versus last year.
890,890,"The focus of the portfolio optimization pillar is to simplify the business, investing where structural advantages exist, while exiting businesses or product lines where the company is not effectively positioned."
891,891,"During the first quarter, we completed installation and began commissioning of the new roasting equipment,"
892,892,"During the first quarter, we continue to advance food safety and quality efforts across the entire manufacturing footprint."
893,893,"The expansion will also add increased processing and filling capacity that will allow us to redistribute current production across our national network of aseptic plants,"
894,894,"Once complete, we expect the expansion will increase our aseptic network capacity by approximately 20%. We are excited about the additional opportunities we will be able to target with this."
895,895,I believe that we have demonstrated in Healthy Beverage a blueprint for success. We are replicating this success across each of our platforms.
896,896,"We believe this pressure is expected to be significant in the second quarter, before moderating in the third and fourth quarters."
897,897,"in the prepared remarks we called out kind of a case study to help people understand all the impact that the Value Creation Plan is making, particularly, on that business and we feel that we can do the same across all of our businesses."
898,898,both of which have improved significantly over the last year. So with that comes credibility and the opportunity to get back in front of customers and be viewed as a long-term strategic partner.
899,899,And we've seen a couple of key wins here in the last couple of weeks in our frozen fruits business that give us confidence that we're going to be able to accelerate that as we go throughout the year.
900,900,So it's the combination of getting into different product categories as well as the benefit of
901,901,it's off to a bit of a slow start because of the weather patterns that have played out this year.
902,902,"Yes, I think it's more -- what we're learning is it's more about the availability of supply of fresh on a year-around basis"
903,903,This call is being webcast and its transcription will also be available on the company's website.
904,904,"Finally, we would like to remind listeners that the company may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during this conference. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures was included with the company's press release issued earlier today."
905,905,"As we discussed last quarter, we have a plan in place to improve financial performance in frozen fruit,"
906,906,We remain focused on building a pipeline of sales opportunities and enhancing relationships with our customers
907,907,"The plan also calls for increased investment in capital upgrades in several manufacturing facilities to enhance food safety and manufacturing efficiencies, of which many are already completed."
908,908,We have largely cleaned up our portfolio and are now focused on strategically investing in key areas to drive growth and margin expansion.
909,909,"and we are expecting to be in commercial production in the third quarter of 2018. This expansion will support further growth of a variety of roasted grains, seeds and plant-based snacks."
910,910,The excellent result in customer audit scores seen across all product platforms is evidence of the success of these activities.
911,911,Efforts under this pillar are expected to improve revenue growth and profitability over time.
912,912,"which is expected to drive cost advantages, while creating needed capacity to continue to support future growth."
913,913,"which is enhancing our readiness for the upcoming fruit season and will allow us to have the right products, in the right place, at the right time to meet our customer service requirements."
914,914,"By first establishing and then standardizing operating procedures in the areas of food and employee safety, quality, production and maintenance,"
915,915,"Finally, after investing in a marketing function that previously had limited resources,"
916,916,"and unfavorable shift in sales mix towards lower margin product offerings and significant cost in manufacturing related to yield losses, excess labor and handling, storage costs and outbound freight."
917,917,All of that's led to the capacity expansion that we spoke
918,918,"which again, gives us confidence that a lot of the work that we're doing in our fruit business is starting -- we're starting to realize the benefits with our customer base"
919,919,but how is that playing out in terms of the composition of your aseptic beverage business? And as part of the capacity expansion or the investments you're making in capacity to bring on new capabilities
920,920,could be nondairy primarily products that have higher solid content levels to deliver a specific nutritional benefit
921,921,And as we targeted different categories for sales opportunities it was definitely one that was at the top of the list.
922,922,"What happened earlier in the year is the growing conditions were near ideal in Southern California,"
923,923,"that tends to drive more of the consumption pattern from frozen into fresh, the pricing obviously is also a component of that."
924,924,"which will take time. However, we continue to make good progress in all parts of the plan, and we are well prepared for a successful start to the strawberry season at our California plants."
925,925,"and as a result, we are incurring increased storage and internal transportation cost as well as heightened fruit sorting, resulting in unfavorable labor and yield variances."
926,926,"Our portfolio optimization efforts during the first quarter included the commercialization of our second roasting and processing line at our organic cocoa facility in Holland, which doubles processing capacity in addition to adding new capabilities."
927,927,"To date, we are converting our sales opportunity pipeline at a rate sufficient to meet our expectations to deliver consolidated revenue growth in the back half of the year."
928,928,"Under the 4 pillars of the Value Creation Plan and with the newly formed leadership team, we set out to address these issues."
929,929,we researched the market and leveraged category insights to identify white space opportunities that accomplished the goal of growing our business in adjacent categories and penetrating new channels to diversify our top line.
930,930,"We expect the impact of these hedge losses to be offset by improved forward margins on cocoa that should be realized over the balance of the year, as we sell through our cocoa position, which grew during the first quarter as a result of the expansion of the cocoa processing facility in Holland."
931,931,"where that business is? And where it was when it was running as efficiently as it could, like several years ago at this point?"
932,932,"And we see good opportunities in all of those categories in the nondairy platform in particular, but also primarily in the retail channels on the broth category."
933,933,"add revenue by 2020 and it sounds like we're going to start growing on a consolidated basis in the second half of this year, so we're moving in that direction. But also bring the margins of the business up"
934,934,"If you looked at your pipeline of conversations and discussions and potential new customers and new wins,"
935,935,And we've seen good conversion on a lot of those opportunities with some
936,936,and we thought at that time that actually there was going to be too much fresh strawberry supply and that the market was actually going to convert to freezer earlier than it normally does.
937,937,go up a bit as due to the delay and the need for processors like ourselves to post some prices to get the growers to start to convert.
938,938,"Based on the prices spread that we're seeing right now though, I don't know that there's going to be a significant enough gap between fresh and frozen to create that dynamic"
939,939,Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the closest GAAP financial measures.
940,940,"Now the good thing, we're implementing our strategy, and we are on track to continue implementing the activities we pointed out from our strategic plan."
941,941,"actually improved our production activities and though it was still somewhat below expectations for the wind resources,"
942,942,"Now guiding to the lower part of the range for '18, there are some impacts that we want to go over. One is that -- related to the storms,"
943,943,We're still looking at the sale of renewables development projects as we talked about last quarter. For those that are in our queue that we may not develop in the near term that -- we can get greater value by selling them off
944,944,"In New York, the AMI and Earnings Adjustment Measurement settlement discussions"
945,945,Maine Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity is on track. We would expect that in early 2019. The Maine DEP approval is going to be in the early to mid of 2019. And
946,946,"Corporate improvements were primarily related to tax impacts, which I will discuss when we review the Corporate segment."
947,947,Those results were impacted by taxes in the third quarter
948,948,"However, we're guiding to the lower part of the range due to the unexpected negative impacts related to the unusual storm pattern that we talked about in the second quarter, and"
949,949,"Finally, while we continue to focus on implementing our existing plan, we also have"
950,950,complete the filing of our tax returns and true-up our tax provision and deferred tax amounts to those tax returns.
951,951,"I would see that you're going to see more -- going forward, more debt there and more interest expense being loaded at the Corporate level."
952,952,"where we sit presently, we're actually ahead of the previous range of our guidance. And we do see potential further upside in the fourth quarter that made us comfortable with that reset."
953,953,"So that's why a big portion of the resiliency plan that we've announced is focused on vegetation management. NYSEG, for example, is the only utility"
954,954,And so that's going to be a big part of the rate proceedings both in Maine and in New York.
955,955,"essentially convert those borrowings into equity so there will be an equity infusion into Renewables, and"
956,956,"No, not necessarily lower than what we had expected in the second quarter."
957,957,"negative impact on GAAP earnings. We will be adjusting that out for our adjusted earnings, so it won't have an effect on it."
958,958,"get that reflected more in rates. And secondly, with the resiliency plan to be able to capture that. Also when you look at"
959,959,"I think similarly, New York has a state tax structure that you essentially pay the higher of"
960,960,we think it's really important from a resiliency standpoint and meeting the expectation of our customers in New York
961,961,this down? Or was this all kind of within the first 2 quarters with the storm impacts
962,962,"okay? So customers will not see a bill increase,"
963,963,"We're continuing to advance on our large projects, and these are ones that are not in our current forecast."
964,964,"which are now excluded when we switch over to the adjusted earnings. And you can see for the quarter, again,"
965,965,and we had a transmission queue that we -- position that we sold this year as well.
966,966,and that was the 800 megawatts. We filed those executed contracts with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities in August.
967,967,offshore wind in the state. We're looking at the number of them in Massachusetts.
968,968,"related to our resiliency program, and we expect to be able to update this during the proceeding."
969,969,"And you'll see that we announced the other day that we will actually now tunnel under the Kennebec River, and we're going to be filing amendments with the DEP for that application."
970,970,"and the examiner's report is scheduled for early December. So we expect receipt of all project approvals by the year-end 2019, and"
971,971,"then the presidential permit, we should have by the end of '19. Now that's predicated on the ISO-New England System Impact Study that has to come first. That study was started on time in August,"
972,972,And we will include it in the rate filing in New York in the first half of '19. And we're already seeing some support from local communities in New York for this type of a program.
973,973,although reduced by the startup and transmission issues that we described in the second quarter.
974,974,"Other impacts that reduced the benefit of the higher rates included higher depreciation and provisions due to new investment, higher bad debt due to a colder winter and the shift from Corporate to Networks for the New York state tax."
975,975,that includes impact on our capital spending that resulted in lower capitalized labor cost.
976,976,along with positive potential impact from the fourth quarter from true-ups of our tax provision and deferred taxes to our tax return.
977,977,"You may recall last year, we had a fairly favorable outcome in the fourth quarter related to that. And any impacts or substantial portion of those impacts would fall to the Corporate segment. So"
978,978,"it may sound pedantic, but to be more specific on the Corporate, in the outlook, you did reduce the midpoint of the assumed Corporate drag for"
979,979,"Yes, and Greg, I don't think it's a structural change more as it is something we see for the upcoming quarter with the tax situation. And we have enough information that says that it looks like it"
980,980,"So while there might be sort of a negative adjustment on the Corporate overheads, we should assume that most of those issues that had caused a delay in revenues or increase in cost this year"
981,981,"for us as a company as we look to restore power but also the benefits that consumers see from that. And we touched on in the presentation but in our meetings with local municipal leaders throughout New York,"
982,982,Can you just walk us through exactly what is booked where and confirm that on a consolidated basis there is no impact whatsoever on adjusted EPS? Yes.
983,983,didn't even have a base case assumption or some kind of output tied to the rate case outcomes at all?
984,984,"different calculations and this particular item we anticipate will continue into the future, so I think that's probably a fair ongoing representation."
985,985,"really was one of the driving factors, we still had some storms in the third quarter, and it got to the point where we weren't able to"
986,986,"again, we need to focus on, okay, how do we minimize these impacts going forward because I can't say that the weather is going to materially change to the better."
987,987,from an efficiency standpoint in the organization. We also had the benefit of a
988,988,by the time we get our next presumably rate increase in July of next year.
989,989,"Well, I want to thank you all for participating. We -- as I said, we had a good quarter and things are looking positive for the future for us. So"
990,990,And the Berkshire Gas case is also in the settlement discussions at this point.
991,991,"We're making great progress on the key approvals for Vineyard Wind, and we'll talk about that during the presentation,"
992,992,"This is the first U.S. offshore wind farm that applied for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management construction and operation plan,"
993,993,"the Massachusetts DPUC approval of contract, they were filed in July, we would expect those in the spring. We don't see any issues with that with the DPU. The Environmental Policy Act"
994,994,because we had some issues that are trailing off. Now
995,995,Timing and approval for the process are really on -- right on track with our expectations.
996,996,And Massachusetts also had a procedural order.
997,997,"And these are things where we can do ground-to-sky clearing, we would call it, that would allow better maintenance of the distribution lines so that we don't -- they aren't as impacted by storms. Some of the other things we're doing would be putting in tree wire,"
998,998,So we're on target to meet the expectations. We're implementing our strategies.
999,999,The Corporate segment for this period was negative due to the new debt issued at AVANGRID in November 2017 and
1000,1000,"and we have a 13% increase in production at our wind farms primarily in the South Texas region and in the West. Pricing was slightly higher overall, reflecting the impact of higher PPA prices and higher merchant prices."
1001,1001,"Well, I think as we move into the future years, we're going to still have"
1002,1002,would be a little bit more positive as far as the tax situation goes
1003,1003,"were also temporal and should reverse next year? Is that fair or unfair? Yes, the ones at Renewables, the"
1004,1004,"there's a growing understanding of how technology can help improve our performance, and they're willing to support us"
1005,1005,"I think it's a slight difference in that. Lower half was kind of a broader range, and we were trying to get people to think about the lower part of the range. So not just"
1006,1006,So that will be permanently now allocated to the Network segment basically from Corporate?
1007,1007,"recover any of the capitalized labor, we weren't getting in the first half in the"
1008,1008,"and so we were better served by really taking an objective look at where we thought we'd come out on the Networks business, and we felt we just need to move it down a little bit."
1009,1009,"I won't get into the details, but essentially, a tax credit we're able to generate on certain investments that we can make,"
1010,1010,"as you mentioned Praful, the addition of new wind farms will be directionally positive from a PTC and effective tax rate standpoint."
1011,1011,"in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation"
1012,1012,somewhat but not entirely by the end of the year. And that's having an impact on our capitalized labor
1013,1013,"The contracts now are expected to be approved by the second quarter of '19, and this just puts it in context with the time frame we expected all along. We received our FERC approval"
1014,1014,"That was filed in September of 2017, and we should have that by mid-2019. And then local and municipal construction approvals will be timed as needed throughout the project."
1015,1015,"replacing poles, undergrounding where it's deemed appropriate. So this is a very comprehensive program to limit and mitigate the impacts from"
1016,1016,"although offset by lower capitalized labor and higher depreciation. Operational results in the Renewables business were also positive for the third quarter of 2018 compared to last year,"
1017,1017,The lower results for the quarter are primarily due to minor storms and related costs
1018,1018,"is due to the seasonal pattern of the wind resource production, as I mentioned earlier, that the third quarter generally is the lowest compared to other quarters."
1019,1019,based on the difference between the former PPA prices and the now merchant prices that we use to sell into that market.
1020,1020,"While Corporate had additional intercompany interest income from Renewables, this was offset by the absence in 2018 of interest income from the gas businesses that we exited earlier this year."
1021,1021,"Regionally, the prices were lower in the West, Mid-Continent and Northeast regions in significantly higher in the Texas region, where we have a number of our merchant projects."
1022,1022,"which is very distinctive in our industry. We have a very robust balance sheet, and our cash flow provides us with flexibility to effectively fund our organic growth plans, including the projects in our current long-term outlook."
1023,1023,"of the dividend to be in line with our EPS growth, subject to this target payout range."
1024,1024,along with lower winds than our normal expectations and then the startup issues that we talked about with the 2 wind projects earlier this year.
1025,1025,incurring more debt going out into the next few years to really fund the Renewable business because we do all the
1026,1026,"and that was an offset to the reduction in some of the -- to some of the headwinds that you were seeing. And I guess, is that -- to put it bluntly, is that just like sort of a"
1027,1027,"we can't predict if there's going to be more minor storms, however, what we are going to do to protect our downside is to make filings with the commission in New York and Maine to try to get more into"
1028,1028,and write letters of support to folks in Albany with regards to investments that need to get made and the trimming that needs to get made to enhance resiliency. So it's a long way of saying we've got to tackle it through
1029,1029,"in terms of additional financing activity, we have some"
1030,1030,"I apologize, I don't have the 2017 comparison for that, but I think we could probably get that for you after the call."
1031,1031,"but it's not that significant of a difference, but it is slightly different, I guess, is the best way to put"
1032,1032,"we end up accelerating depreciation on that for accounting purposes so that by the time the nacelle is replaced, it has 0 net book value or essentially the salvage value."
1033,1033,I think you were talking about potentially not filing in New York for future case.
1034,1034,"And as I mentioned, we've gotten very supportive comments from local communities that have been"
1035,1035,"and that credit peaked in 2017. So by the time you look at where we are now for 2018, that credit's smaller. We've increased rate base. We have certain costs that have gone up. We want to insert resiliency. So"
1036,1036,are all also designed to help with the transition of the deposit base of WashingtonFirst down the road
1037,1037,We continue growing core deposits from both retail and commercial banking relationships.
1038,1038,"leading into that, we had work groups from both companies collaborating to determine what's in the best interest of both the client relationship and the employees. So"
1039,1039,"The work between the teams at Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst is going well, and they're working closely together to deliver a smooth and successful transition."
1040,1040,"in most cases, folks that have been sitting in a seat in their headquarters will continue to do so. And we're modifying our process"
1041,1041,"Our call is open to all investors, analysts and the news media, and there will be a live webcast of today's call as well as a replay of the call available on our website later today."
1042,1042,"Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measures such as net income, operating income, net cash flows provided by operating activities or any other GAAP measures of liquidity or financial performance."
1043,1043,highlighting our great-tasting fresh Mexican food and executing at the highest level.
1044,1044,"In addition, we will add talent and skill to our leadership team in the coming weeks to further drive and focus our brand building efforts."
1045,1045,"This expected outcome will achieve our initial goal of mid-single-digit new system unit growth in 2017, which is only the starting point of our unit growth opportunity"
1046,1046,While also pursuing our robust emerging market opportunity and specifically focusing on our efforts to create regional scale in the Southeast where we continue to gain increased traction with new and existing franchisees.
1047,1047,"to successfully lap last year's accelerated performance, our plan is to drive comprehensive improvement across the brand employing a threefold strategy."
1048,1048,"Second, we believe we have continued opportunity and try both check and transaction growth through our new incremental platforms"
1049,1049,"Okay. And last one for me, obviously the delivery test in Vegas must be going well or you wouldn't be expanding it. Can you give us any kind of numbers on incremental revenues or"
1050,1050,we should expect additional additions there? Or if you feel like you got the team in the right spot going forward to kind of be able to hit all those strategic guidance across
1051,1051,Did it get maybe a little bit easier? Just trying to think about what kind of performance hurdles are ahead of you to lap over
1052,1052,"it came into the business. And so there's been a real focus on just improving the experience at dinner, and we're seeing that in our overall satisfaction scores during that daypart as well as seeing some nice speed improvements. So that's"
1053,1053,"incremental cost pressures in the business, was curious how you might balance that out in terms of what's kind of eating up some of those extra sales. Is it relatively balanced between"
1054,1054,"In order to deliver and unlock our potential, we'll need a highly talented and focused leadership team."
1055,1055,"First, I am excited to announce the addition of a CMO role to the business, that's Chief Marketing Officer."
1056,1056,This balanced and discipline approach has us on a path to further accelerate system growth in 2018 and beyond.
1057,1057,drove significant breakfast day part same-store sales improvement over Q1 as both new product lines resonated extremely well.
1058,1058,"First, we will continue our intense focus on operating at a higher level year-over-year, concentrating on overall satisfaction and speed."
1059,1059,reinforce our occasion expansion capability and enable exciting future product innovation across our menu. And it may be positioned to drive both traffic and check.
1060,1060,Second quarter company-operated comparable restaurant sales growth represents the 20th consecutive quarter of gains
1061,1061,"happening -- it has been happening for a couple of months now in Las Vegas and there's still lots to learn there. And the usage is fairly low on that just now because it's in the app environment,"
1062,1062,during the quarter. I wanted to see if you could provide a little detail on that. But
1063,1063,and really help to kind of codify the leadership group and the things that need to happen as we think about moving forward and
1064,1064,need to enact and have the people that we need to be able to drive that performance. We've seen really great momentum from our operations and our franchise group
1065,1065,We have been searching for the right fit for several months and we have hired a highly talented marketing executive. Details will be announced shortly.
1066,1066,"On the marketing and product front, Q2 was driven by a combination of factors."
1067,1067,"We've had proven success with premium ingredient innovation in the past, including fresh sliced avocados and fresh-grilled Carne Asada steak. And we believe Queso can play a similar role in our fourth quarter."
1068,1068,net of an estimated reduction in store weeks based on the timing of new company restaurant openings that will occur later in the year than originally expected.
1069,1069,"but now as we extend beyond the app environment, which is move two that we talked about on the last call, with our partnership with GrubHub. We'll start to see restaurants in Orange County, Los Angeles and even in Las Vegas"
1070,1070,"probably more importantly, I wanted to see if I could get some color on the timing of the openings, now that we're into July. In terms of thinking, specifically company-operated,"
1071,1071,on that particular line item. Can you just give me a little more color on that?
1072,1072,the key pillars of growing this brand. So I couldn't be more excited about where we stand as these few moves happen here over the next few weeks.
1073,1073,This individual has great brand-building experience across several company and franchise concepts in the QSR category with a proven track record of success. So we couldn't be more excited for that hire.
1074,1074,"As we look toward the future, our powerful brand momentum has greatly enhanced our unit economic model, which has generated significant interest from new and existing franchisees, eager to grow with us to expand our reach."
1075,1075,"The timing of Easter, which gave us nearly 3 weeks of Lent in Q2 this year versus none last year,"
1076,1076,We will leverage both platforms in the back half of 2017 in our marketing and innovation mix to achieve our brand and business objectives.
1077,1077,"Initial guest satisfaction scores are extremely strong, a testament to the culinary innovation team's ability to create craveable menu items and our operator's readiness to launch promotional products."
1078,1078,"Our highly disciplined process to develop a new ingredient like Queso began over a year-ago, followed by restaurant level tests that began early this year to successfully commercialize the program to make consumer expectations around quality,"
1079,1079,"Finally, I want to provide a progress update on the expansion of our mobile and online ordering test that is now available in more than 50 restaurants."
1080,1080,"This improvement was primarily driven by assets that became fully depreciated in the prior fiscal year, partially offset by the addition of new assets."
1081,1081,"That's also benefited the mix, both of those as John said had dedicated marketing windows during the second quarter, so we really got some nice momentum out of those product lines."
1082,1082,"on that platform, which will be outside of the app environment in that third-party environment. So we'll get some great learnings off of that over the next few months and see where we're out with the consumer demand dynamics, which still focused on really trying to"
1083,1083,it sounds like you're guiding to maybe 12 or even 13 additional openings through the remainder of this year. Can you give me a sense of timing splits between Q3 and Q4 openings on those?
1084,1084,part of what we knew we would need to do is deliver a combined solution to market. And part of that
1085,1085,whether this can happen this year or you're happy with how it is now and just shipping there your slab?
1086,1086,here we should say that all the excessive cash which we are going to
1087,1087,"according to the market prices as you mentioned, the political expectations and so on"
1088,1088,"And then, I think if you think about the 2 projects that are going down into the Carolinas, that will help sort of the Dominion South"
1089,1089,There's really no change also in the water assets just like in the gas gathering system. There's no change in the ownership of those between our sponsors. And so
1090,1090,So both sponsors will benefit from the drop equally in the future.
1091,1091,The conference has now concluded. Thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.
1092,1092,"At the conclusion of their remarks, we will open the phone lines for questions. Joe Fink, our Chief Operating Officer, is also with us and will be available for questions during that time."
1093,1093,Our forward-looking statements or comments about future expectations are subject to a variety of business risks.
1094,1094,"and, most importantly, the efforts and dedication of our operations team led by Joe Fink. So I'd like to offer a word of thanks to all those responsible for our success"
1095,1095,"As we anticipated, this resulted in our net throughput volumes declining slightly from the second quarter."
1096,1096,the ability for each sponsor to then drill at the pace they want to drill it. So there's really no change from a CONE perspective
1097,1097,there's no reason that this joint venture split should create any difficulty in being able to drop that.
1098,1098,These risks are more fully described in our public filings with the SEC. Reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures are contained in this morning's press release.
1099,1099,and to also express our appreciation to the investors who have placed their confidence in the CONE team.
1100,1100,total CapEx for the quarter was reduced by delays in receiving permits for the scheduled facility expansion
1101,1101,"Sure. I'd say a couple of things. One is the increased volume of interest we've had people coming to CONE, asking us to"
1102,1102,"We'll think about what our duration of what those views will be, and I think that will hopefully answer your question too. When I go back to the term I use a lot, it's stay tuned."
1103,1103,It may be possible at some point in the future that there is a restructuring in CONE Gathering.
1104,1104,Total gross operating expense during the third quarter was flat with the second quarter.
1105,1105,decision-making should be quicker as these issues are no longer worked first through the joint development committee and then approved by each of the sponsors.
1106,1106,"and the potential for rising activity by sponsors and meaningful third-party business, we are hopeful that we can be in position to provide a longer forward view on our performance and growth expectations."
1107,1107,"I think I've been pretty clear, I'd always rather do one before I need to do one. So"
1108,1108,"in your view, is the most mature and most likely to be dropped in? And are there any public benchmarks or expected returns we can look at for what that valuation might look like?"
1109,1109,That's led to close collaboration with a key customer to support a major custom-product development project.
1110,1110,we expect our switch and tuner revenue will expand this year with significant growth in the second half.
1111,1111,"During the March quarter, we released 5 PAM4 solutions for data center interconnect applications. In the optical space, leading customers want greater speed and capacity with lower power consumption and costs,"
1112,1112,"our forecast outlook for the full year fiscal '18 looks good. Operationally, we continue to make solid progress on yield improvements,"
1113,1113,"I know there's a ton of projects out there that are pulling in BAW, but they're not -- they're still in the design phase."
1114,1114,"Then you'd see a peak in the December quarter, and then you'd see normal seasonality in the March quarter, down."
1115,1115,"I also commented that it was a second half phenomenon, so these phones hasn't been released, some of them. So"
1116,1116,"so we have the full suite of technologies needed to address each of these markets. And we are trying to align our best opportunities not just in terms of dollar growth, but also in terms of profit growth"
1117,1117,We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain noncash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance.
1118,1118,"In both Mobile Products and IDP, we are expanding our product portfolios to deliver superior performance and increasing functionality."
1119,1119,Looking to mobile. Qorvo is a leader across multiple categories with exciting growth opportunities from the transceiver to the antenna.
1120,1120,"To be clear, this module integrates all major RF functions required in the main path,"
1121,1121,highly integrated solution for our wireless infrastructure customers seeking to quickly and cost effectively implement pre-5G massive MIMO networks.
1122,1122,"This is our fifth facility to earn automotive certification, further validating our long-term commitment to the automotive market."
1123,1123,We intend to continue buying as part of an ongoing commitment to return capital to our shareholders.
1124,1124,"This technology, along with our proven design capabilities,"
1125,1125,"The product that I talked about in my opening comments that was one of the most challenging and complex that the industry has really seen is taking very complicated multiplexers that are BAW-based,"
1126,1126,"And you're right, we are seeing just a lot of adoption for that. It really, in some way, simplifies, lowers the cost and increases the performance in WiFi when you do away with the SIP and go"
1127,1127,"I think now we've had enough detailed discussion with our customers, and it's really limited to really just a couple of customers there"
1128,1128,and I would anticipate that it would go down in future years.
1129,1129,"Also, we said we're going to grow our content, so I don't know if your question was over share or dollars. We're looking at dollars that we can drive, and we don't always have visibility into who's winning what"
1130,1130,"We have a highly differentiated position there, many years and successive generations of pushing the limits of what can be done."
1131,1131,"This is translated into large design wins and has given us greater confidence in our growth drivers. Specifically, we expect to expand our dollar content at our largest customer later this year,"
1132,1132,"We are improving the RF performance of our customers' devices with highly integrated solutions, complemented by our expanding portfolio of highly differentiated discrete components."
1133,1133,"In mobile, we expect to increase our dollar content at our largest customer later this year, and we are forecasting"
1134,1134,is providing us the opportunity to work on the industry's most complex integrated modules
1135,1135,We are serving our customers better and performing more consistently and efficiently in the process.
1136,1136,that's driving a lot of that growth this year and then the following year will be that continuation along with others that I talked about.
1137,1137,we're not really trying to compare ourselves to Skyworks. We're saying we're going to grow as fast as the market and sometimes faster. So we feel good about what we're doing.
1138,1138,it's driving some of our OpEx expenses as well. And I think it's worthy of the investors to know that
1139,1139,"on every RF application. But we feel good about our ability to grow our dollars at our second and third, along with our largest customer in the second half of the year."
1140,1140,for GaAs and Texas for GaN. And then the -- just a raft of supply chain sourcing initiatives
1141,1141,"And with no further questions in the queue at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks."
1142,1142,This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today
1143,1143,and we're forecasting expanding dollar content at our second and third largest customers
1144,1144,"We're extremely pleased to have earned this opportunity that requires a multiyear commitment, and we're competing to win."
1145,1145,"including ZigBee, Bluetooth low energy and Thread. Our SoC solution is ideally suited for remote control applications and opens the door for opportunities"
1146,1146,"The vast majority of that is China,"
1147,1147,"Additionally, we talked to you about handset delays. One of those handsets, one of the regional models actually ended up getting canceled."
1148,1148,"Could you give us an idea of where it's at today, if possible, so we can try to size the expansion there?"
1149,1149,could China stay relatively muted as we go through the year because of those dynamics?
1150,1150,"as we've progressed through each of these phases of architecture, where we have the opportunity to bring in a lot of our leading filter technology, like BAW 5 as well as our SAW and TC-SAW portfolio,"
1151,1151,"I hesitate to give a number on a given quarter, plus there's just timing of payments and things like that. We paid a bit more in fourth quarter than we thought"
1152,1152,"Thank you for joining us tonight. Qorvo's leveraging our unique combination of competitive strengths to address our market's most complex, most rewarding"
1153,1153,We expect that we'll be able to improve revenues and margins in this area as our offshore operations are set up to take this business ramp-up fully in terms of knowledge and number of people.
1154,1154,"When I evaluate any company's performance over any period of time as an acquisition target or an investment target, I look at a number of key metrics that help me analyze their"
1155,1155,"In many of these enterprise deals, we were deploying highly complex end-to-end solutions that had never been implemented by any other vendor or client."
1156,1156,"in terms of other metrics like customer concentration and customer attrition. Ebix has built a business with very little customer concentration, with no other -- with no one client"
1157,1157,"In recent times, I have looked at lots of large companies in our sector and the net debt they carry on their balance sheet. While many of these companies have performed well in terms of top line growth, yet,"
1158,1158,and state-of-the-art quality processes. Our expertise in that area can be understood from the basic fact that we started deploying
1159,1159,"We feel that there's an opportunity to take an early place in these markets and deploy exchanges to trace and move money digitally across retailers, distributors, corporates, consumers and banks."
1160,1160,"of which segments those fall in. And in particular, any margin impact in terms of margin uplift or drag as it related to those new contracts?"
1161,1161,"or varying sizes. And so I think at this minute, I would just stop at that and not talk about specific areas of where we think that business can come in."
1162,1162,"And one way to ensure a standard of education, especially in countries with large population, is to provide"
1163,1163,to do this claims processing in India. Part of it was we were not only trying to target
1164,1164,"The health content revenues were impacted negatively by many factors, with the key ones being comparative price dropping"
1165,1165,"business fundamentals and future viability of their business. Frankly, when you get close to a subject, you tend to lose your objectivity,"
1166,1166,"or even 17-year comparative metric, in my book, Ebix again had a great year on this metric. In terms of operating margins, sometimes back,"
1167,1167,That's what made it even more remarkable. A complex deployment like PPL in London required us to carry the entire London reinsurance market together
1168,1168,"Before I go into aspirational goals for Ebix, I want to talk about a few key areas in which we would like to possibly take the company."
1169,1169,"simply because the nature of the business requires selling the same asset on a cloud computing basis and recurring basis to a large number of clients. Again, if we enter this area, it will be through a decent size sensible acquisition."
1170,1170,"Well, I think I couldn't go into specifics of any of these deals, simply because we're in a competitive situation and we wouldn't want to talk about it. But I think I could answer it in terms of"
1171,1171,"a wide margin versus my estimate for the quarter. And just trying to figure out how much of that came from acquisitions through the quarter. So help us size what the impact was and then,"
1172,1172,"We've proven that not only do we have the solution, we have also proven that we can implement it in a timely basis and make it very successful."
1173,1173,"that exercise can never finish. You have to keep your feet on the ground, and you have to always look at cost synergies, you always have to start keep thinking about how do you make yourself more efficient."
1174,1174,the current opportunities we're working on. We were trying to create a business model. We were trying to create a business model that we can replicate and multiply.
1175,1175,"and has a big role to play in their overall dynamics of efficiency. If Ebix can step in and provide the back-end systems,"
1176,1176,and I'm quite aware of the risk of Ebix management suffering from the same. So I try to look at Ebix in the same manner as any other company and study its performance
1177,1177,it's important to ensure that it can deploy large enterprise deals on a timely basis.
1178,1178,and cater to its varying needs and yet drive a common market aggregation platform.
1179,1179,"We would like to expand the company into the area of financial exchanges, especially in the area of cash settlement and digital money."
1180,1180,"Now let me briefly talk about new aspirational goals for Ebix. Let me start by saying that these aspirational goals,"
1181,1181,We are in the lead position to enable and power some of the world's largest insurance exchanges.
1182,1182,"we have some deals that are signed. Again, I wouldn't want to talk about the size of those deals right know, and we will let the market know once we have approvals from those clients to talk about them in the press"
1183,1183,It's kind of hard for me to answer that question because most of these acquisitions are relatively small that we made
1184,1184,"So right now, our big focus is expanding the number of products in London, expanding, adding new accounting functionality to it, launching some of the more"
1185,1185,talk a little of some actions you've taken on cost-cutting and also shifting some
1186,1186,"At the same time, we look at India as a quality center, as a learning center for us, where we can multiply knowledge, where the same -- rather than be dependent on one individual in one particular specific"
1187,1187,"Sean and I will talk about the company from a financial perspective, while Robin will delve into the qualitative aspects of the quarter, the year and the future ahead of us."
1188,1188,"partially offset by the drop in revenue from our health content and life sciences businesses, in addition to the effect of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our international revenues."
1189,1189,and the purchase of new buildings in India to support our expanding world-class product development facilities. The
1190,1190,Darren and Sean have already covered the quarter and the full year in numerical terms. I'll try to focus my comments on a number of topics.
1191,1191,on each of these metrics simply to hopefully give the management an ambulant view of Ebix performance.
1192,1192,This is extremely important if the company wants other large prospective clients to deploy EbixEnterprise solution.
1193,1193,It allows us tremendous opportunity for growth as and if we decide to leverage the company a bit more.
1194,1194,"We see this as a big opportunity, especially in emerging countries where the governments are trying to ensure that"
1195,1195,while getting others to underwrite that risk and simply be an exchange in the middle.
1196,1196,"We also believe that we need to concentrate on the areas of aggregation, wherein we have little competition."
1197,1197,We will continue to pursue those targets. Our banking syndicate under the leadership of Regions Bank has been strong in the support of our effort.
1198,1198,large insurance companies who are already doing it and have thousands of people exactly in that area doing that.
1199,1199,That's great. And then going back to the price increases that you alluded to that we'll get some more detail on.
1200,1200,"Obviously, as time passes, we would expect to see some scale just because of the revenue growth"
1201,1201,"And again, the approach is no different than what we've done nearly since our inception. We've got a great network of partners and"
1202,1202,"we're trying to provide information now to the financial community, but we don't want to get in front of our customer communications. So we're leaving it the way it is right now and not signaling to any specific area of the business."
1203,1203,"big as I think you can, that you're going to have to be more than a gaggle of kind of one-off tools. So how -- when you kind of sit down, how do you think about communicating that differentiation that you have over -- we all know the"
1204,1204,"And you've also seen at summit last year we previewed the new home experience, for example, bringing a lot of the applications together to give you sort of a centralized"
1205,1205,"expand with additional use cases as either we, through our marketing or our channel through kind of direct touch with the customer,"
1206,1206,hundreds of different countries that work with customers intimately in understanding kind of the expansion paths and what the products can apply to. We try to make that also friction-free in the way that we market the products and expand kind of the use cases that they can apply.
1207,1207,"back to, I think, what we've celebrated as a company is just customer choice. And so whether you're a small company or a large company,"
1208,1208,"how you're seeing it progress versus the JIRA Software product? And then kind of in that same vein, how are you seeing adoption outside of the traditional software user within customers? It's"
1209,1209,"because we did have that budget flush. And some of that does tend to come through the channel. And this quarter, receivables came down a little bit as they collected on that and kind of normalized in terms of where we are in kind of a seasonal basis, not being on a"
1210,1210,"on our IR website. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results is included in the filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time,"
1211,1211,"But at this point, we prefer not to talk about it and rather just kind of focus on our commercial operations"
1212,1212,"I think you'll see that both drawing our products in. But also, we have a huge customer base within which Trello is"
1213,1213,and there's just a lot more for us to do to capture that. And we think we've got a model that generates good profitability and tremendous cash flows. And so
1214,1214,a credit to all of the vendors in there that are really spending time with those customers and finding those use cases and building them on top of our applications.
1215,1215,And Confluence has the same aspects in terms of creating a piece of content and then pulling in lots of different
1216,1216,I would like to turn the conference back over to Mike Cannon-Brookes for any closing remarks.
1217,1217,But it's also a great example of the commerciality of the marketplace working really well
1218,1218,"If you think about both Confluence and Trello, they often play a really important coordination role"
1219,1219,"and the fact that it caps out as 2,000 users. I'm just curious as to what degree you're seeing customers sort of reach"
1220,1220,"Great. And then if I could get one more. On the competitive front, you've got the Slack and teams out there making at least some noise publicly. I was just wondering if you've seen any changes or expect anything to materially"
1221,1221,"we believe in this, to really make this competence-based sale, we have to be organized around the industries in which we want to build the competence. And that's where this structure just helps us a lot better"
1222,1222,"whatever was the corresponding depreciation totaling to that residual value of 5% has been completely written off. And going forward, every software that we take will be provided over the life,"
1223,1223,"it was a little bit of a slow start, maybe I was more optimistic on how enthusiastic"
1224,1224,driving this whole rebuild exercise in the software sales part or the license sale part? If you could just throw some light on that?
1225,1225,"today, I can't sense a major challenge in any of the top 20. Sure. Krishna, this question was more to understand that, if those challenges we had at the beginning of last year are not there this year."
1226,1226,We saw decreases in insurance assessments and commissions during the quarter compared to last year's second quarter.
1227,1227,"it seems like you're almost pushing the line a little harder on pricing even as competition picked up. Was that just something that you looked at, at the end of the quarter? And"
1228,1228,Our commitment to maintaining discipline enhances our financial stability for the protection of our policyholders and our shareholders.
1229,1229,"Before I discuss the operations this quarter, I'd like to provide some color regarding the workers' compensation industry in general as competition continued to intensify this quarter."
1230,1230,The decline was driven by both policies written in the quarter as well as audit and related adjustments for policies written in prior quarters.
1231,1231,"Over the past year, our allocation to municipal bonds has increased slightly, and our allocation to corporate bonds has decreased slightly."
1232,1232,"well -- significantly below AMERISAFE's. And at that point, we're not going to chase the price that low."
1233,1233,I feel like you're kind of moving from being overcapitalized to maybe really overcapitalized. And I don't know if there's any thought of kind of how to manage that if you have to continue to be really selective in a soft market.
1234,1234,This call is being recorded. Replay of today's call will be available. Details on how to access the replay are in the earnings release.
1235,1235,"implemented, that you're going to be a bit more aggressive on the pricing front?"
1236,1236,"would assume we'd be a little bit more pricey than they were accustomed to or looking for. So if we were to purchase a renewal book, I'm not quite sure how much of that we would actually retain."
1237,1237,"This recognition was for outstanding financial results in the areas of safety, consistency and performance"
1238,1238,"if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect or as a result of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including factors discussed in today's earnings release,"
1239,1239,"While comparing consecutive quarters is not apples-to-apples, I do feel this emphasizes our commitment to risk selection with appropriate pricing for long-term stability."
1240,1240,The significant driver of this increase was the decline in value of a limited partnership hedge fund in last year's second quarter.
1241,1241,These gains are not reflected on our book value as these bonds are carried at amortized cost.
1242,1242,"We're probably -- I'm probably going to be a little bit more cautious on this call than maybe we have been in prior calls in giving state-specific data because it is highly competitive out there, and I wouldn't want to give away competitive data."
1243,1243,"appropriate rates for the client, that the client can accept, at the same time, commissions that are beneficial to the agent."
1244,1244,Was there anything unusual outside of the mark-to-market on the alternatives like bond prepayment or anything unusually good in the quarter just from kind of a core yield perspective in the general account?
1245,1245,"Nautilus undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements to reflect new information, events or circumstances after they were made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, unless otherwise indicated."
1246,1246,"when adjusted for certain unusual items that we discussed on our preliminary results call earlier this month -- last month, and which Sid will review later in his remarks."
1247,1247,and we believe that we are now better positioned for modest but steady margin improvement in coming quarters. Bill will touch on this more during his remarks.
1248,1248,"We evaluated many acquisition candidates over the course of more than a year, and are extremely excited about the strong synergistic and cultural fit that we have with Octane."
1249,1249,"We also expect the sales seasonality of the newly acquired business to be more aligned to our retail channel, with Q3 and Q4 being the seasonally heavy revenue and operating income quarters."
1250,1250,"We believe that the overall environment for the holidays was challenging, and we were very pleased that we were able to maintain strong product margins throughout the quarter."
1251,1251,"While our own inventories are elevated over prior year, this primarily reflects our higher revenue and support for growth."
1252,1252,"Our Retail outlook for the full year is also positive. The addition of Octane Fitness revenue and profit to our results will be accretive, and we anticipate Octane to grow this year as well."
1253,1253,within the global market and via a variety of bricks-and-mortar locations. I'd like to emphasize again Sid's earlier comments that both our legacy retail business
1254,1254,"As we begin 2016, we are well positioned to deliver another year of strong sales and profitability growth."
1255,1255,"higher revenues, new product introductions and the addition of a new distribution center."
1256,1256,I wanted to provide a quick update on accounting-related matters regarding our acquisition of Octane Fitness before I turn it over to Bill.
1257,1257,"As these products gain traction over time, we anticipate that they'll continue to help stabilize the TreadClimber category, which still represents an important and significant level of cardio product sales for Nautilus."
1258,1258,"We're encouraged by the strong contribution of several recent product launches,"
1259,1259,"During 2015, we focused much of our effort on this improvement, and it was driven by a variety of factors, including pricing, value engineering, supply chain and mix optimization."
1260,1260,"We continue to make good progress on overcoming the manufacturing challenges we uncovered during initial production. We are in production now, and we do anticipate launching this product on a wider scale in the near future."
1261,1261,"Our legacy retail business is also very healthy overall, especially so given the margin improvements we've recently been able to implement."
1262,1262,"Of note, the combination of our 2 companies will introduce the shift in our channel mix as Octane revenue and profit is added to the overall Nautilus results."
1263,1263,"Over the past few years, we have significantly broadened and enhanced our product portfolio in both the Direct and retail businesses."
1264,1264,"Our employees' dedication and enthusiasm is the oil that enables our growth engine to hit on all cylinders,"
1265,1265,"retail partners there, just there's a lot of moving parts, you've got online growth, you have the potential for"
1266,1266,"I think that Direct, because of the significant comps that we have"
1267,1267,And we think it's a good time right now to be spending to gain additional leads and conversion.
1268,1268,"who have a lot of experience with that market and, specifically, with those who sell in that market."
1269,1269,"estimated earnings accretion, and other anticipated benefits and cost of the acquisition of Octane Fitness."
1270,1270,Bill McMahon will then provide details on each business segment as well as updates on product activity.
1271,1271,This sales growth reflects continued retailer and consumer acceptance of our lineup of
1272,1272,"Before I turn the call over to Sid, I would like to touch briefly on our acquisition of the Octane Fitness,"
1273,1273,The dollar increase was driven by additional resources to continue to supplement our new product development capability that is required to innovate and broaden our product portfolio.
1274,1274,"We are continuing to work through the purchase accounting and appropriate valuation of the Octane assets and liabilities,"
1275,1275,"While it's important to remember that retail margins were impacted due to our normal seasonal variation in revenue versus fixed channel expenses,"
1276,1276,we're optimistic and anticipate delivering continued growth in revenue and profitability for all segments of our business.
1277,1277,"As Sid noted in his remarks, we have taken a reserve against the receivable for one of our national sporting goods retailer accounts."
1278,1278,"Before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to briefly touch on our recent acquisition of Octane Fitness and our plans regarding the integration of that business."
1279,1279,"However, our focus will remain the same. We will apply our combined product development capabilities towards the most promising projects."
1280,1280,"With the acquisition of Octane, we are now adding more product and channel diversity to our well-established platforms for future growth."
1281,1281,and it is their initiative that has allowed us to accomplish so much over the past several years and to build a strong and growing company for our shareholders.
1282,1282,"and we continue to work closely with all of our bricks-and-mortar partners to put the right combination on the floor. So overall, we certainly anticipate continuing to grow our Retail business,"
1283,1283,"going into even the first quarter, that you will see maybe a little bit less growth there than you might see on the Retail side,"
1284,1284,"But that's, I guess, all we can say at this point in time. We hope that there will still be some business with that customer as the year progresses,"
1285,1285,It's being very well received. People are excited about the product. I think it was time for Airdyne to return to that space.
1286,1286,"We're trying to maintain a regular cadence. So as we speak, we have multiple ideas in the Direct pipeline that we're pursuing. Some are closer to market than others."
1287,1287,I will then close with some summary remarks before we open up the call for questions.
1288,1288,Our sales benefited from this continued build in demand of the Bowflex Max Trainer as well as encouraging early sales and consumer interest
1289,1289,"and the amounts noted on the balance sheet presented reflect provisional estimates. Based on some preliminary work completed on valuations of certain intangible assets,"
1290,1290,and we are continuing to see favorable response rates as we progress through Q1 2016. Now turning to our Retail segment.
1291,1291,"based on our current outlook, overall, the relative gains in margin we have achieved should be sustainable moving forward."
1292,1292,"Our distribution centers handled extremely high volumes of shipments in December with tight service windows, and they did so quite efficiently."
1293,1293,"In Direct, we continue to experience strong response to our television and digital advertising while associated conversion remains solid thanks to healthy payment mix of financing and credit card sales."
1294,1294,"We maintain a cautious approach to credit lines in a variety of situations, and we'll continue to do so wherever warranted going forward."
1295,1295,"Importantly, our team also continues to remain focused on successfully leveraging operating costs and continually finding improved efficiencies in our business."
1296,1296,That concludes our prepared remarks. I would like to now open up the call for questions. Operator?
1297,1297,"although there certainly will be a little bit of consolidation, at least with one of them."
1298,1298,"we will keep our placements, and if it's maybe a little less testing or a little bit of trying things that we haven't tried because it's too expensive to do that. So we plan for this. I don't anticipate it will impact our outward"
1299,1299,"Sure, Lee. We still maintain a 3-year product road map, where we look out at a cadence of launches and product ideas that are in various stages of coming to market."
1300,1300,"Retail is a little more set cadence of pace. Every fall, you need to have something for Retail."
1301,1301,we will reevaluate our options as to how best to utilize free cash in an effort to enhance shareholder value.
1302,1302,and originally expected that this reduction would be carried out in a slower-phased manner
1303,1303,"As such, we accelerated our consolidation efforts during the quarter in order to further reduce the cost structure of this business."
1304,1304,"All in all, this project has been executed very smoothly with no customer disruptions"
1305,1305,in the second half of the year and potentially as early as the second quarter.
1306,1306,"Negotiations continue on multiple fronts with respect to this margin-dilutive business, but we do not expect a final resolution until the end of the second quarter,"
1307,1307,Much of this margin expansion will clearly come in the second half of the year.
1308,1308,"So high volumes, all at low margins. But we clearly track what's going on in the underlying business excluding that."
1309,1309,And much of that was on an expedited basis as it became clear that the customer was going to be able to transition faster than we would like.
1310,1310,the lost customer with additional business from new customers or additional business from existing customers.
1311,1311,"Yes. I think one of the things to keep in mind is, if you look at the profile of our volume last year, the first quarter comp was pretty tough."
1312,1312,"we clearly internally have our own thoughts about how these negotiations are going. For obvious reasons, we're not going to talk about that publicly at this point."
1313,1313,is that segment grew on a local currency basis at that rate
1314,1314,were in the very low single digits. So that still has not happened.
1315,1315,I think that's going to be a governor. But the corollary of that is it is likely to keep prices higher.
1316,1316,and then the old warehouse will be converted to a manufacturing space in the second half of this year.
1317,1317,I will begin with the income statement and conclude by providing comments on our balance sheet and cash flow.
1318,1318,for the comparable period in 2016. This improvement was a result of lower interest expense from refinancing our debt in July of last year.
1319,1319,The closure of the 3 facilities were completed in the first quarter without issue.
1320,1320,of positive cash provided by operating activities during the first fiscal quarter.
1321,1321,"throughout this year and into 2018. However, the transition is going much faster than anticipated. And while the total number and volume of profiles to be transitioned has not changed,"
1322,1322,"and. The first phase, which involves mostly high-volume production assets and tooling, should be complete by the end of our second quarter."
1323,1323,"And we can clearly see that our operational improvement program, some of the automation efforts are gaining traction, even though it doesn't show up in the consolidated number for the first quarter."
1324,1324,"So we have 3 facilities. We will consolidate much of the accessory low-volume business into the smaller of the 3, which is in Illinois."
1325,1325,"By the time we finish the moves there, which should be complete by the end of the second quarter, the capacity utilization of that facility will also probably be in the 80% range."
1326,1326,"So as we exit this year, we'll start to see more and more focus there on growing that business back again"
1327,1327,does that speed up the pace of your automation investments
1328,1328,"So that the real gating item, we can't go faster because we just can't get it fast enough."
1329,1329,"So with new homes at high prices, potential increases in mortgage rates,"
1330,1330,it is now evident that all of this volume will transition by the end of our fiscal year.
1331,1331,"and 23 extrusion lines have been taken out of service. 2 lines have been relocated and are now operational, 2 more lines are in the process of being moved,"
1332,1332,The final phase of this project will be to consolidate all of our low-volume accessory business into our Illinois facility.
1333,1333,This was primarily due to a ramp-up in volumes of the previously identified margin-dilutive business
1334,1334,"Either way, however, we should start to see margin expansion in this business beginning slowly in the second quarter and ramping up significantly through the second half of this year."
1335,1335,We feel very good about the actions we have taken this year to shrink our U.S. vinyl profiles and cabinet components businesses while still expanding margins and improving free cash flow.
1336,1336,the day we made the announcement. We ceased production immediately in that operation
1337,1337,"are getting great productivity out of the lines that are in place, and they are anxiously awaiting new equipment deliveries."
1338,1338,I think that labor constraints will still
1339,1339,I think we will see more people make the decision they're going to stay in their existing homes because it's more cost effective
1340,1340,The decrease was primarily attributable to our previously disclosed decision to walk away from less profitable volume
1341,1341,"Over the next few months, we will incur expenses as we relocate the remaining equipment and displace older and less efficient equipment."
1342,1342,"We remain focused on generating free cash flow. And similar to last year, we expect to pay down debt as the year progresses, which will ultimately further improve our leverage ratio."
1343,1343,and an additional 11 will be moved during the second quarter. 8 existing extrusion lines have been modified
1344,1344,as we initiated discussions around increasing the pricing or transitioning this business to alternate suppliers.
1345,1345,"While progress has been slower than we would like in our cabinet components business,"
1346,1346,"and committed to our customers that we would manufacture that product for them, at least for the first 60 days, which was most of our first quarter, at Mexican prices but of course at U.S. costs."
1347,1347,We already have price increases on the table for all of the margin-dilutive business
1348,1348,"Yes. So first of all, let me say that the team in our vinyl profile business have done a phenomenal job in the first quarter"
1349,1349,"But I think at this point I would say, if you have to nail down one number, I would guide you to the midpoint of that range."
1350,1350,"to Europe, the strong volume growth. Can you go into detail a little bit more on that strong growth and how we should think about"
1351,1351,"put a governor around new housing starts, which is why many"
1352,1352,"and then, as prices continue to escalate, make the decision to renovate their existing properties."
1353,1353,"Our performance in Latin America is affected by the weakness of the market and the choice to protect our value,"
1354,1354,"And so we stay out from these arena. And we still have opportunities to reduce in Europe as well as, of course, in South America."
1355,1355,"Let's go through the results by regions and our strategy for 2019, starting from the High Value regions,"
1356,1356,"In Asia Pacific, the new JV in China will allow us to increase our High Value capacity, to better size market opportunities in China and in the other Asia Pacific countries."
1357,1357,by reducing our exposure to the less profitable products and lower rim size and by increasing prices in Argentina and lately in Brazil
1358,1358,"the more there will be growth in the top line. I mean, the decrease in the top line is related to the standard reduction."
1359,1359,should rebound but is related to contracts that we already have in hands that are starting with new models
1360,1360,"These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to various risks, uncertainties and assumptions as discussed in detail in our 2017 10-K as well as our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission."
1361,1361,The remainder of our asset portfolio performed as expected and reported continued saving results during the third quarter.
1362,1362,"Phase 2 of this project, which will extend or recontract existing legacy volumes on this line"
1363,1363,the results of which are still pending and are expected to be announced by month's end.
1364,1364,"Nathan will return and wrap up our remarks and close with some key takeaways. Following the prepared remarks, I will ask the conference operator to coordinate the questions."
1365,1365,"First, though, because of the highly contracted nature of our pipeline assets, we expect that they will continue to perform in a consistent matter -- manner with past periods and thereby produce steady predictable results."
1366,1366,Portland is working with the mainline to capture the next wave of growth opportunities on this path in response to these market drivers.
1367,1367,"The increase was due to the same factors impacting net income, together with the reduction in distributions allocated to both our General Partner"
1368,1368,underway. So I think we should be pushing on this one fairly quickly over the next two quarters and we hope to have more news
1369,1369,We continued to execute our regulatory strategy in response to the FERC actions earlier this year.
1370,1370,"And then Iroquois as well, has some potential but I think it's a little bit more built out at this point."
1371,1371,And distributable cash flow is presented to provide a measure of cash generated during the period to evaluate our cash distributions capabilities.
1372,1372,providing a competitive path to market with a fairly minimal environmental and regulatory footprint.
1373,1373,is driving additional market interest in the Portland System.
1374,1374,Any thoughts there on expectations? And are you kind of already maybe speaking with shippers to
1375,1375,"And to make this one company out of, slightly 20 companies in the past. There are still some investment"
1376,1376,but we have seen no issue or challenges in the income range.
1377,1377,"So I do want to stress, this is a problem or challenge that we are very happy to have instead of having the reverse challenge. And"
1378,1378,We all look forward to speaking to and seeing many of you over the next couple of weeks and months.
1379,1379,to boil the ocean. I hope that was a meaningful answer to your question.
1380,1380,"If in the meantime, you have any questions, as always, please don't hesitate to reach out to Christian,"
1381,1381,"we have once again a record crowd joining our call today. So I would ask you to really limit your questions to 2, and also to those of you who are"
1382,1382,"the input cost as well. I have to say, the channel mix is pretty much a neutral one as we are"
1383,1383,"remind everybody where we are. We are in the process of fundamentally changing our company through creating the new strategy, and building a stronger adidas for the future."
1384,1384,"yes, even so we don't see the leverage yet that we all wish to see in the future. There's probably 2 reasons for it. As I indicated earlier, we are significantly investing"
